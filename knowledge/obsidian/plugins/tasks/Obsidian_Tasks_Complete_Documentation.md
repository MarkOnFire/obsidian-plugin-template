[#plugin/reminder](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Notifications#plugin/reminder)
Within Tasks, notifications can be made possible by utilizing [obsidian-reminder](https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder). This utilizes the standard Tasks date (as the due date) and can be extended with an additional reminder date by including a ⏰ and a date/time in the format `⏰ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. Further, a default reminder can be enabled based on the Tasks' 'Due Date'. To enable this make sure obsidian-reminder has enabled the tasks plugin format as below:
![obsidian-reminder setting](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/reminder.png) _Note that this is a screenshot of the reminder plugin's settings and not Tasks._
The order is important when writing the task. Tasks requires the reminder date after the task description and before any other Tasks fields. Reminders [requires no content between the reminder date and the due date](https://uphy.github.io/obsidian-reminder/guide/interop-tasks.html#distinguish-due-date-and-reminder-date).
```
- [ ] #task task name ⏰ YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm 📅 YYYY-MM-DD ⏫ 🔁 every week 🛫 YYYY-MM-DD ⏳ YYYY-MM-DD

```

* * *
Warning
The output of the "Create or Edit Tasks" command will not put the due date directly behind the reminder date where Reminders wants it. You must fix this manually if you want to use the Reminders "defer" command; **otherwise (as of August 2022), using the Reminders "defer" command will overwrite all information between the ⏰ and 📅 emoji!** See [this issue in Reminders to check the current status](https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder/issues/100).

![Create or Edit Modal](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/modal.png)   
The `Tasks: Create or edit` command helps you when adding or editing a task.
Use the command 'Tasks: Create or edit task' to launch the modal.
  * If the cursor was on an existing task, the modal will modify that task's properties.
  * If the cursor was on a blank line, the modal will create a brand new task on that line.


Released
Introduced in Tasks 1.17.0.
All the fields of the form have "access keys", that is, keyboard shortcuts. The access keys are displayed as the underlined letters in the labels.
  * On Windows, press the `Alt`-key and the underlined letter at the same time.
  * On Mac, press `Ctrl`-key and the `Option`-key and the underlined letter at the same time.


See [Hotkey and keyboard shortcut conflict](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task#Hotkey%20and%20keyboard%20shortcut%20conflict) below for important information relating to keyboard shortcuts and the hotkey used to open this modal.
Released
Introduced in Tasks 1.17.0.
If the access keys (keyboard shortcuts) for any field conflicts with system keyboard shortcuts or interferes with assistive technology functionality that is important for you, you may want to turn them off in the Tasks plugin's settings:
![Create or Edit Modal](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-provide-access-keys-in-dialogs.png)
This setting takes immediate effect, and does not require restarting of Obsidian.
This is the text describing your task.
If you have a [global filter](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Global+Filter) enabled, the dialog takes care of adding it automatically.
The description box can be enlarged by dragging its corner. Multi-line text can be pasted in, or dragged-and-dropped in, and Tasks will remove the end-of-line characters automatically.
Released
Description field became resizable in Tasks 2.0.0.
See [priority](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Priority).
Here you can make the task recur, so that when it is marked as done, a new task is created, with newer dates.
Tip
A task with a recurrence rule is required to also have at least one of Due, Scheduled or Starts dates.  
See [Recurring tasks must have at least one date](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks#Recurring%20tasks%20must%20have%20at%20least%20one%20date).
See [recurring tasks (repetition)](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks).
Here you can optionally give the task [due](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Due%20date), [scheduled](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Scheduled%20date) and [start](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Start%20date) dates.
You can also add or edit [created](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Created%20date), [done](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Done%20date) and [cancelled](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Cancelled%20date) dates.
There is a lot of flexibility here. For example:
  * You can type in exact dates, such as `2022-11-28`.
  * You can also enter parts of dates, such as `6 oct`.
  * You can enter relative dates, such as `today`, `tomorrow`, `Saturday`, `10 days`, `2 weeks`.


Note that relative dates will be always interpreted as being in the future, because that is usually what you want. You can change this behavior by unchecking "Only future dates" if you want to enter an overdue task or experiment with the way how relative dates in the past would be interpreted in queries.
Info
If you have enabled ‘Set created date on every added task’ in Tasks settings (and restarted Obsidian), when you create a new Task via this modal, today's date will be added automatically.
Released
  * `Only future dates` was introduced in Tasks 1.15.0.
  * Editing of [created](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Created%20date), [done](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Done%20date) and [cancelled](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Cancelled%20date) dates was introduced in Tasks 5.5.0.


Released
Introduced in Tasks 7.13.0.
The modal provides a date picker, for easy selection of dates for your tasks.

This page describes ways to add, edit and remove date values on tasks.
There is a [Date-picker on task dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Editing+Dates#Date-picker%20on%20task%20dates) and a [Context menu on task dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Editing+Dates#Context%20menu%20on%20task%20dates), or you can use various [other date-editing options](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Editing+Dates#other%20date-editing%20options).
Released

[#plugin/quickadd](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Tasks+Api#plugin/quickadd)
Released
The Tasks API Interface was introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.
Tasks exposes an API that can be used to integrate Tasks in other Plugins, scripts or dynamic code blocks.
The Tasks API is available from `app.plugins.plugins['obsidian-tasks-plugin'].apiV1`, where `app` is the Obsidian App. A reference to the Obsidian App is usually available via `this.app`, however, this depends on the context of the executing script.
This is the interface the API exposes:
```
/**
 * Tasks API v1 interface
 */
export interface TasksApiV1 {
    /**
     * Opens the Tasks UI and returns the Markdown string for the task entered.
     *
     * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that contains the Markdown string for the task entered or
     * an empty string, if data entry was cancelled.
     */
    createTaskLineModal(): Promise<string>;

    /**
     * Opens the Tasks UI pre-filled with the provided task line for editing.
     * Does not edit the task line in the file, but returns the edited task line as a Markdown string.
     *
     * @param taskLine The markdown string of the task line to edit
     * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that contains the Markdown string for the edited task or
     * an empty string in the case where the data entry was cancelled.
     */
    editTaskLineModal(taskLine: string): Promise<string>;

    /**
     * Executes the 'Tasks: Toggle task done' command on the supplied line string
     *
     * @param line The markdown string of the task line being toggled
     * @param path The path to the file containing line
     * @returns The updated line string, which will contain two lines
     *          if a recurring task was completed.
     */
    executeToggleTaskDoneCommand: (line: string, path: string) => string;
}

```

##  `createTaskLineModal(): Promise<string>;`
Released
This method was introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.
This method opens the Tasks [Create or edit task UI](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task) and returns the Markdown for the task entered. If data entry is cancelled, an empty string is returned.
```
const tasksApi = this.app.plugins.plugins['obsidian-tasks-plugin'].apiV1;
let taskLine = await tasksApi.createTaskLineModal();

// Do whatever you want with the returned value.
// It's just a string containing the Markdown for the task.
console.log(taskLine);

```

Warning
This function returns a `Promise` - always `await` the result!

One of the most common usage scenarios is probably in combination with the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) plugin to automatically add tasks to a specific file.
See [Launching the Create task modal via QuickAdd](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Other+Plugins/QuickAdd#Launching%20the%20Create%20task%20modal%20via%20QuickAdd) for full details of how to do this.
##  `editTaskLineModal(taskLine: string): Promise<string>;`
Released
This method was introduced in Tasks 7.21.0.
This method opens the Tasks [Create or edit task UI](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task) with the provided task line pre-filled for editing. If data entry is cancelled, an empty string is returned.
```
const tasksApi = this.app.plugins.plugins['obsidian-tasks-plugin'].apiV1;
let editedTaskLine = await tasksApi.editTaskLineModal('- [ ] My existing task');

// Do whatever you want with the returned value.
// It's just a string containing the Markdown for the edited task.
console.log(editedTaskLine);

```

Warning
This function returns a `Promise` - always `await` the result!
##  `executeToggleTaskDoneCommand: (line: string, path: string) => string;`
Released
This method was introduced in Tasks 7.2.0.
Executes the 'Tasks: Toggle task done' command on the supplied line string. It toggles and updates a task line according to a user's preferences, accounting for recurrence rules and completed status. It returns a string representing the toggled task.
```
const tasksApi = this.app.plugins.plugins['obsidian-tasks-plugin'].apiV1;
const sourceFile: TFile = file;
const taskLine = '- [ ] This is a task 📅 2024-04-24';

const result = tasksApi.executeToggleTaskDoneCommand(taskLine, sourceFile.path);

// Do whatever you want with the returned value.
// It's just a string containing the Markdown for the toggled task.
console.log(result); // "- [x] This is a task 📅 2024-04-24 ✅ 2024-04-23"

```

Released
This integration was introduced in Tasks 7.2.0.
Plugins that [extend Obsidian's markdown editor](https://gist.github.com/Fevol/caa478ce303e69eabede7b12b2323838) can control if and when Tasks' [Auto-Suggest](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Auto-Suggest) displays by implementing a `showTasksPluginAutoSuggest` method on the extended editor class. This method must adhere the function definition below.
```
/**
 * Returns
 * - true to explicitly request that the suggest be displayed
 * - false to request that it be hidden
 * - undefined to defer to Tasks' default behavior
 *
 * @param cursor The current cursor position in the editor
 * @param editor The editor instance
 * @param lineHasGlobalFilter True if the line the cursor is in matches the
 *        global filter or if no global filter is set
 */
showTasksPluginAutoSuggest(
  cursor: EditorPosition,
  editor: Editor,
  lineHasGlobalFilter: boolean
): boolean | undefined

```

This can be used, for example, to display the Auto-Suggest on non-task lines. [See the Kanban plugin for an example](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/blob/5fa792b9c2157390fe493f0feed6f0bc9be72910/src/components/Editor/MarkdownEditor.tsx#L100-L106).
Warning
If the `Editor` is not a `MarkdownView`, the functionality is slightly limited. It won't be possible to create [Task Dependencies](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies) fields `id` and `dependsOn`.

Follow the steps below to install Tasks.
  1. Search for "[Tasks](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin)" in Obsidian's community plugins browser
  2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find "Tasks" under "Community plugins").
  3. Check the settings. It makes sense to set the global filter early on (if you want one).
  4.      * I recommend you remove the original toggle checkbox hotkey and set the "Tasks" toggle to `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on a mac).
  5. Optional: bind a hotkey to the command `Tasks: Create or edit` to have quick access to the Tasks modal.

[#feature/dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#feature/dates)
This section explains the different types of date that you can add to task lines, in order to tell Tasks when you wish/need to do the work.
You don't have to use all available dates. Maybe due dates are sufficient for you. Don't over-engineer your task management.
Info
Instead of adding an emoji and a date manually, you can use the `Tasks: Create or edit` command when creating or editing a task. When you use the command, you can also set dates like "Monday", "tomorrow", or "next week" and Tasks will automatically save the date in the correct format. You can find out more in [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task).
Info
If you prefer to type, it is now very easy to add emojis and other information for your tasks using [Intelligent Auto-Suggest](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Auto-Suggest).
* * *
Tasks can have dates by when they must be done: due dates.
In order to specify the due date of a task, you must append the "due date signifier 📅" followed by the date it is due to the end of the task. The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, meaning `Year-Month-Day` with leading zeros.
For example: `📅 2021-04-09` means the task is due on the 9th of April, 2021.
```
- [ ] take out the trash 📅 2021-04-09

```

  * [Sorting > Due Date](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Sorting#Due%20Date)

  * Accessible as [task property](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Task+Properties#Values%20for%20Dates%20in%20Tasks) `task.due`


* * *
Tasks can have dates on which you plan to work on them: scheduled dates. Scheduled dates are different from due dates as you can schedule to finish a task before it is due.
Scheduled dates use an hourglass emoji: ⏳.
```
- [ ] take out the trash ⏳ 2021-04-09

```

See also:
  * [Use Filename as Default Date](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Use+Filename+as+Default+Date) for how to optionally make Tasks use any dates in file names as the scheduled date for all undated tasks in that file.
  * [Remove scheduled date on recurrence](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks#Remove%20scheduled%20date%20on%20recurrence) for controlling whether new recurring tasks are automatically scheduled.

* * *
It can happen that you cannot work on a task before a certain date. Or you want to hide a task until a certain date. In that case you can use start dates.
Start dates use a departing airplane emoji: 🛫
```
- [ ] take out the trash 🛫 2021-04-09

```

When [filtering](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters#Start%20Date) queries by start date, the result will include tasks without a start date. This way, you can use the start date as a filter to filter out any tasks that you cannot yet work on.
Such filter could be:
```
```tasks
starts before tomorrow
```

```

This section explains the types of dates that Tasks can add for you automatically.
The date types in this section are optional.

Image of the default settings for tracking task histories.
Released
Created date was introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.
If you enable 'Set created date on every added task' in settings (and restart Obsidian), the Tasks plugin will help you track when your tasks were created.
See the [screenshot](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Date-tracking%20settings) above.
Created dates use a heavy plus emoji: ➕.
```
- [ ] take out the trash ➕ 2021-04-09

  * Accessible as [task property](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Task+Properties#Values%20for%20Dates%20in%20Tasks) `task.created`


The following Tasks facilities add created dates to tasks...
... automatically, if created date is enabled:
  * [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task), when it creates a brand new task
  * When you complete a [recurring task](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks), the new task's created date will show the date it was added.


... upon request, and always enabled:
  * `➕ created today` option in [Auto-Suggest](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Auto-Suggest). 
    * Note that this is a long way down the list of suggestions, so you may need to start typing a couple of characters from `created` or `today` to see it.


Unless you disable 'Set done date on every completed task' in settings (and restart Obsidian), the Tasks plugin will help you track when your tasks were completed.
See the [screenshot](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Date-tracking%20settings) above.
Done dates use a white check-mark emoji: ✅.
```

Released
Cancelled date was introduced in Tasks 5.5.0.
Unless you disable 'Set cancelled date on every cancelled task' in settings (and restart Obsidian), the Tasks plugin will help you track when your tasks were cancelled.
See the [screenshot](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Date-tracking%20settings) above.
Cancelled dates use a red cross-mark emoji: ❌.
```

  * Accessible as [task property](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Task+Properties#Values%20for%20Dates%20in%20Tasks) `task.cancelled`


Tasks does not automatically report any problem tasks that have invalid dates, such as on the 32nd day of a month. These task will silently not be found by date-based searches.
However, it is possible to search for any tasks with invalid dates in your vault: see [Finding Tasks with Invalid Dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters#Finding%20Tasks%20with%20Invalid%20Dates).
Warning
The date values on task lines must be calendar or absolute dates, referring to a specific year, month and day. Text such as `📅 today` is not understood by the Tasks plugin, and will not be found in searches.
  * The date format on task lines is not yet configurable.
  * The only format recognised is `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2024-09-17`.
  * It is not possible to customise the format of date values on task lines.
  * It is also not possible to format dates as links, such as `[[2024-09-17]]`.
  * We are tracking this in [discussion #69](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/69).


  * It is not yet possible to include times on task lines to indicate when they _should_ be acted on.
  * Nor is it possible to record the time when tasks were created, completed or cancelled.
  * We are tracking this in discussions [#607](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/607) and [#668](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/668).


  * The following are out-of-scope for the Tasks plugin: time-tracking, productivity tracking, pomodoros, notifications and similar.
  * We recorded this in [discussion #2721](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/2721).

Tip
Since Tasks 3.5.0, a new [Global Query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query) facility has been added, which offers a lot more flexibility than the Global Filter.
You can set a global filter in the settings so that Tasks only matches specific checklist items. For example, you could set it to `#task` to only track checklist items as task if they include the string `#task`. It doesn't have to be a tag. It can be any string. Leave it empty to regard all checklist items as tasks.
Example with global filter `#task`:
```
- [ ] #task take out the trash

```

If you don't have a global filter set, all regular checklist items will be considered a task:
```
- [ ] take out the trash

```

Warning
If you use a tag such as `#task` as the global filter, you cannot add sub-tags to that tag.
The following settings in the Tasks Options pane control the vault's global filter.
Note you must restart Tasks after changing any settings here.

Tasks tracks your checklist items from your vault. The simplest way to create a new task is to create a new checklist item. The markdown syntax for checklist items is a list item that starts with spaced brackets:
```
- [ ] take out the trash

```

Now Tasks tracks that you need to take out the trash!
Info
You can write tasks using any of the following list styles:
```
- [ ] task starting with a hyphen

* [ ] task starting with an asterisk

+ [ ] task starting with a plus sign

1. [ ] a task in a numbered list with a `.` character

2) [ ] a task in a numbered list with a `)` character

```

Released
  * Support for tasks with `+` was introduced in Tasks 4.5.0.
  * Support for numbered lists with `)` was introduced in Tasks 7.18.5.


To list all open tasks in a markdown file, simply add a [query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/About+Queries) as a tasks code block like so:
```
```tasks
    not done
```

```

Now you have a list of all open tasks! This is enough to get started with tasks. You can _optionally_ start using one or more of the other features that Tasks offers. Like, for example, [priorities](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Priority) or [dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Start%20date).
This Tasks User Guide almost entirely uses Emoji to add data to your tasks.
However, if you prefer to use text instead of Emoji, see [About Task Formats](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/About+Task+Formats) for other options.
A more convenient way to create a task is by using the `Tasks: Create or edit` command from the command palette. You can also bind a hotkey to the command. The command will parse what's on the current line in your editor and pre-populate a modal. In the modal, you can change the task's description, its due date, and a recurrence rule to have a repeating task.
You can find out more in [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task).
See other pages in 'Getting Started' for more details on due dates and recurrence, and many other features.
You cannot toggle a task (un)done in the modal. For that, do one of the following.
There are two ways to mark a task done:
  1. In preview mode, click the checkbox at the beginning of the task to toggle the status between "todo" and "done".
  2. `Tasks: Toggle Done`. 
     * The command will only be available if the cursor is on a line with a checklist item.
     * You can map the command to a hotkey in order to quickly toggle statuses in the editor view (I recommend to replace the original "Toggle checklist status" with it).
     * If the checklist item is not a task (e.g. due to a global filter), the command will toggle it like a regular checklist item.


A "done" task will have the date it was done appended to the end of its line. For example: `✅ 2021-04-09` means the task was done on the 9th of April, 2021.
Warning
Whenever Tasks behaves in an unexpected way, **please try restarting Obsidian**.
Warning
Tasks only supports **single-line checklist items**.
The task list rendered through this plugin **and** the checklist items from which the task list is built render only the first line of the item. Text after the first line in a multi-line checklist item is ignored (but is unaffected in the stored `.md` file).
This works:
```
-   [ ] This is a task
    -   This is a sub-item
    -   Another sub-item
    -   [ ] And a sub task
        -   Even more details

```

The following _does not work:_
```
-   [ ] This task starts on this line
        and then its description continues on the next line

```

We are tracking this in [issue #2061](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2061).
Tasks can read tasks that are in **numbered lists**.
Released
  * Reading tasks inside numbered lists was introduced in Tasks 1.20.0.
  * Reading tasks inside numbered lists with `)` was introduced in Tasks 7.18.5.


For example:
```
1. [ ] Do first step
2. [ ] Do next step
3. [ ] Do following step

```

or:
```
1) [ ] Do first step
2) [ ] Do next step
3) [ ] Do following step

```

Editing and toggling tasks in numbered lists works fine: the original number is preserved.
Warning
However, when these tasks are displayed in tasks blocks they are displayed as ordinary bullet list items.
This is because they will usually be displayed in a completely different order than in the original list, often mixed in with tasks from bullet lists. The original numbers in this case just don't make sense.
Warning: Obsidian bug in versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.3 has caused some tasks not to be found
See [Missing tasks in callouts with some Obsidian 1.6.x versions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tasks+in+callouts+with+some+Obsidian+1.6.x+versions) for how to make Obsidian 1.6.5 fix its metadata cache, in case it was broken by earlier 1.6.x versions.
Tasks can read tasks that are inside [blockquotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1) or [Obsidian's built-in callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts).
Released
Reading tasks inside callouts and blockquotes was introduced in Tasks 1.11.1
Warning
However, under the following very specific circumstance, Tasks cannot add or remove completion dates or make the next copy of a recurring task:
  * Obsidian is in **Live Preview** editor mode (pencil icon in lower right corner),
  * AND the task's markdown is in a **callout** ,
  * AND the user **clicked on the task's checkbox** to complete or re-open the task.


If you toggle a task's status in this situation, you will see a warning. Use the command `Tasks: Toggle Done`, or switch to Reading View (book icon in lower right corner) to click the checkbox.
Completing a task by clicking its checkbox from a `tasks` query block _will_ work in any editor mode, even if the query is inside a callout.
We are tracking this in [issue #1768](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1768).
Warning
When tasks are in callouts, any preceding heading in the callout is not read by Tasks, so `group by heading` uses the previous heading outside the callout - or `(No Heading)` if none.
We are tracking this in [issue #1989](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1989).
Warning
Tasks cannot read tasks that are in **Obsidian Canvas cards**.
We are tracking this in [issue #2100](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2100).
Warning
Tasks cannot read tasks that are **inside code blocks** , such as the ones used by the **Admonitions plugin**. Use Obsidian's built-in callouts instead.
Obsidian supports two styles of **comments** :
  * `<!-- I am text in a comment -->`
  * `%% I am text in a comment %%`


Warning
By design, Tasks does **not** read any tasks that are inside these comments, because Obsidian does not read them.
Warning
Tasks can only render **inline footnotes**. Regular footnotes are not supported.
```
-   [ ] This is a task^[with a working inline footnote]
-   [ ] This footnote _will not work_[^notworking]

```

See also [About Queries > Footnotes are not displayed in query results](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/About+Queries#Footnotes%20are%20not%20displayed%20in%20query%20results).
Warning
Tasks' support for **blockquotes inside tasks** is limited. It renders correctly, but since Tasks only supports a single line, the meta-data of the task will be inside the blockquote.
Warning
Tasks won't render **spaces around list items** if you have a list with empty lines (typically known as ['loose' lists](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#loose)).
```
-   [ ] First task before the empty line

-   [ ] Another task. The empty line above will _not_ result in the tasks being more spaced out.

```

Warning
Tasks reads task lines **backwards from the end of the line** , looking for metadata emojis with values, tags and block links. As soon as it finds a value that it does not recognise, it stops reading.
This means that you can only put **block links** (`^link-name`) and **tags** after metadata such as dates, priorities, recurrence rules. Anything else will break the parsing of dates, priorities and recurrence rules.
```
-   [ ] Task with priority placed before tag _priority will be recognized_ 🔼 #tag
-   [ ] Task with date placed before tag _date will be recognized_ 📅 2021-04-09 #tag
-   [ ] Task with date placed before other text _date will be not recognized_ 📅 2021-04-09 other text
-   [ ] Task with block link _works_ 📅 2021-04-09 ^e5bebf

```

We are tracking this in [issue #1505](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1505).
If you are concerned that some values in a task are not being parsed as you intended, perhaps because a task is not being found by Tasks searches, you can:
  * view an individual task in the [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task)
  * search for all possible problems: see [Finding unread emojis](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/Find+tasks+with+invalid+data#Finding%20unread%20emojis).


If there are any **Tasks emojis visible in the Description field** , close the modal and delete or move to the left any unrecognised text.
![Create or Edit Modal](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/modal-showing-unparsed-emoji.png)   
The `Tasks: Create or edit` modal showing a due date that was not parsed, due to trailing `other text`.
Warning
Tasks only supports checklist items in markdown files with the file extension `.md`.

Tasks can be recurring. In order to specify a recurrence rule of a task, you must append the "recurrence signifier 🔁" followed by the recurrence rule. For example: `🔁 every weekday` means the task will repeat every week on Monday through Friday. Every recurrence rule has to start with the word `every`.
When you toggle the status of a recurring task to anything but "todo" (i.e. "done"), the original task that you wanted to toggle will be marked as done and get the done date appended to it, like any other task.
In addition, _a new task will be put one line above the original task_ by default.
See [Order of the new task](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks#Order%20of%20the%20new%20task) below, for how to change this behaviour and make the new task appear _on the line below the original task_.
The new task will have updated dates based off the original task.
Tip
If you only want the latest occurrence, and don't care to see the clutter of all the earlier tasks, check out the new [On Completion](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/On+Completion) facility, added in Tasks 7.8.0.
Take as an example the following task:
```
- [ ] take out the trash 🔁 every Sunday 📅 2021-04-25

```

If you mark the above task "done", the file will now look like this:
```
- [ ] take out the trash 🔁 every Sunday 📅 2021-05-02
- [x] take out the trash 🔁 every Sunday 📅 2021-04-25 ✅ 2021-04-24

```

The next Sunday after 25 April 2021 is on 2 May.
Alternatively, if you have enabled addition of [created dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Created%20date), the file will instead now look like this, showing the date that the new task was created:
```
- [ ] take out the trash 🔁 every Sunday ➕ 2023-03-10 📅 2021-05-02
- [x] take out the trash 🔁 every Sunday 📅 2021-04-25 ✅ 2023-03-10

```

Use this setting to control where the recurring task is inserted. The default is to put the new task before the original one.
![Setting for next recurrence appearance](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-recurrence-location.png)
Released
Control of the location (or order) of the new task was introduced in Tasks 3.8.0
Use this setting to control whether the Scheduled date should be removed from the next occurrence. The Scheduled date is only removed the task also has a Start or Due date.
This is useful when you want the Start and Due dates to carry forward to the next recurrence, but you will set the Scheduled date in future, once you know when you intend to work on it.
![Setting for Remove scheduled date on recurrence](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-recurrence-remove-scheduled-date.png)
Released
The option to remove the scheduled date on recurrence was introduced in Tasks 7.19.0.

[#feature/statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/Custom+Statuses#feature/statuses)
Released
Custom Statuses were introduced in Tasks 1.23.0.
Custom statuses represent any non-standard markdown tasks.
Here are some tasks with example custom statuses, that is, with non-standard characters between the `[` and `]`:
```
- [X] Checked
- [-] A dropped/cancelled task
- [?] A question
- [/] A Half Done/In-progress task

```

They **require custom CSS styling or theming** in order to display correctly in Tasks blocks or Live Preview.
Here's the kind of thing that you can do with custom statuses and styling:
![Selection of checkboxes from Minimal theme](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/theme-minimal-reading-view-sample.png) ![Selection of checkboxes from ITS theme](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/theme-its-reading-view-sample.png)
People have been using themes and CSS snippets to style custom checkboxes in Obsidian all along.
What Tasks' custom statuses allow you to do is to **also customise the behaviour of your tasks**.
This is what the Custom Statuses look like initially in Tasks' settings, showing the two custom statuses that Tasks provides by default:
![Default custom statuses](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-custom-statuses-initial.png)
And this is how you can use them:
Status Symbol | Next Status Symbol | Status Name  
`status.name includes...`  
`sort by status.name`  
`group by status.name` | Status Type  
`status.type is...`  
`sort by status.type`  
`group by status.type` | Needs Custom Styling  
---|---|---|---|---  
`/` | `x` | In Progress | `IN_PROGRESS` | Yes  
`-` | `space` | Cancelled | `CANCELLED` | Yes

[#feature/statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses#feature/statuses)
Released
Custom Statuses were introduced in Tasks 1.23.0.
This page provides an overview of using Tasks with **Custom Statuses** , which some people refer to as Custom Checkboxes or Alternative/Alternate Checkboxes.
Here's the kind of thing that you can do:
![Selection of checkboxes from Minimal theme](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/theme-minimal-reading-view-sample.png) ![Selection of checkboxes from ITS theme](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/theme-its-reading-view-sample.png)
Once you're comfortable with the background information in this page, further information is available in the following related pages.
  * [How to style custom statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/Style+custom+statuses).
  * [How to set up your custom statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/Set+up+custom+statuses).
  * [About Status Collections](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Status+Collections/About+Status+Collections).
  * [Check your Statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/Check+your+Statuses).


If you are happy with all your tasks beginning with `[ ]` and `[x]`, then **no** , you can just ignore Tasks' Statuses facility.
Every task in the Tasks plugin now has a Status.
Status is just Tasks' name for:
  1. the character (`symbol`) between the `[` and `]` in a task line
  2. AND some options that you can customise, to tell tasks how to treat all your tasks with that character.


Some obsidian users call them other names, like 'Alternative Checkboxes', but that is more about how they are displayed, rather than about the actual _behaviour_ of tasks with particular statuses.

[#feature/statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/Status+Settings#feature/statuses)
This is what you see in the Tasks settings when you first look at the Task Statuses section:
![Initial Task Statuses Settings](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-statuses-initial.png)  
_Initial Task Statuses Settings_
There are two sections:
  1. **Core Statuses**
     * These are statuses that are built in to Tasks, and cannot be deleted.
     * They are the two task types that are built in to Obsidian and Tasks natively: `[ ]` and `[x]`.
     * Their status symbols cannot be changed.
     * All their other properties can be edited.
  2. **Custom Statuses**
     * These statuses are what many themes call 'custom checkboxes'.
     * You will need to choose and install a Theme or CSS Snippet that supports 'custom checkboxes'
     * Tasks automatically adds `[/]` and `[-]`
     * And this is where you can add your own custom statuses.


We also see that each status consists of:
  * **Status Symbol** (for example, `x` and `-`)
  * **Status Name** (for example, 'In Progress')
  * **Next Status Symbol** (for example, `x` and `space`)
  * **Status Type** (one of `TODO`, `DONE`, `IN_PROGRESS` or `CANCELLED`)


This adds a new, empty row to the Custom Statuses section.
![An empty Status, which can be edited and deleted](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-custom-statuses-new-empty-status.png)  
_An empty Status, which can be edited and deleted_
You can then click its Pencil icon and fill in the details for your new Status.
This button populates the Custom Statuses list with all the statuses supported by the Minimal Theme.
You may wish to delete the default custom statuses first, so that you only see the Minimal statuses.
![The first few statuses supported by Minimal](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-custom-statuses-minimal-theme-first-few.png)  
_The first few statuses supported by Minimal_
The [Minimal Theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Status+Collections/Minimal+Theme) page shows the full list statuses that will be added, and what they look like in that theme.
This button populates the Custom Statuses list with all the statuses supported by the ITS Theme, and also the identical SlRvb's Alternate Checkboxes.
![The first few statuses supported by ITS Theme and SlRvb's Alternate Checkboxes](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-custom-statuses-its-theme-first-few.png)  
_The first few statuses supported by ITS Theme and SlRvb's Alternate Checkboxes_
You can see screenshots, and the statuses that will be added:
  * [SlRvb’s Alternate Checkboxes](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Status+Collections/SlRvb's+Alternate+Checkboxes)
  * [ITS Theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Status+Collections/ITS+Theme)


Tasks knows about a growing list of custom checkboxes in Themes and CSS Snippets.
You can find a full list, with screenshots and complete details of the supported checkboxes, in [About Status Collections](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Status+Collections/About+Status+Collections).
This searches all the tasks in your vault for any with status symbols that are not already in Tasks settings. It then creates a new custom status for each unknown status symbol.
The new statuses are sorted by their symbols. This can be a convenient way to populate the Custom Statuses settings.
For example, in a vault that has already used a few custom statuses, we might see:
![Example result from adding all Unknown statuses](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-custom-statuses-add-unknown-statuses.png)  
_Example result from adding all Unknown statuses_
This resets the entire Custom Statuses section back to its default list.
This allows you to try out each of the buttons above, and if you don't like them, you can quickly undo their changes.
  *     * There is no visual feedback in the settings pane if there are any duplicates
    * You have to confirm the actually loaded statuses by running the 'Create or edit task' command and looking at the Status drop-down.
  *     * The mechanism to remember which sections were collapsed is not yet working.
  * Usability wise, it would be good if the 'Add New Task Status' button opened the modal to immediately edit the new status.
  * Ideally, the lists of statuses, with their delete and edit buttons, would be a table instead, with the ability to edit the properties directly in the table, instead of having to open up a modal.

For performance reasons, Tasks is stricter in reading data from markdown lines that some users expect.
As a precaution, it can be useful to check the data in your vault periodically, to see if there are any tasks with seemingly valid data that is not found by Tasks.
In the following task, there is unrecognised text after the due and done dates.
```
 - [x] check 📅 2022-12-29 ✅ 2023-01-09 > appointment 19.1.

```

Tasks sees as an un-dated task with the text description:
`check 📅 2022-12-29 ✅ 2023-01-09 > appointment 19.1.`
The following tasks block lists any tasks that have emoji in the description, which usually means data that has not been interpreted by Tasks. This is typically because there is some text other than emoji signifiers and tags at the end of the line.
```
```tasks
# These instructions need to be all on one line:
(description includes 🔺) OR (description includes ⏫) OR (description includes 🔼) OR (description includes 🔽) OR (description includes ⏬) OR (description includes 🛫) OR (description includes ➕) OR (description includes ⏳) OR (description includes 📅) OR (description includes ✅) OR (description includes ❌) OR (description includes 🔁) OR (description includes 🏁) OR (description includes ⛔) OR (description includes 🆔)

# Optionally, uncomment this line and exclude your templates location
# path does not include _templates

group by path
```

```

The errors can be fixed by editing the Task and moving any text that appears after the unparsed values to earlier in the line.
This task has an illegal due date:
```
- [ ] Do stuff 📅  2023-12-32

```

The following tasks block lists any tasks with invalid dates, meaning data that has potentially not been interpreted by Tasks.
```
```tasks
# These instructions need to be all on one line:
(cancelled date is invalid) OR (created date is invalid) OR (done date is invalid) OR (due date is invalid) OR (scheduled date is invalid) OR (start date is invalid)

# Optionally, uncomment this line and exclude your templates location
# path does not include _templates

group by path
```

```

Errors with invalid dates are not easily fixed using the [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task), as it shows any invalid dates with placeholder text, instead of showing the original values.
So to fix any found tasks, use the [backlink](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Backlinks) to navigate to the original line and fix the error there.
The following finds tasks that are likely to have invalid recurrence rules, as they are seen as not recurring, despite having the 🔁 emoji.

[#css](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/How+to+style+buttons#css)
In Tasks results, by default each task is displayed with two buttons – one to [edit](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task) the task, and one to [postpone](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Postponing) the task, using corresponding icons. In the current version of Tasks they look they this:
![Task buttons with default style](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/tasks-buttons-default.png)
At least they look like this on Windows 11 - icons may appear slightly different on different platforms.
If you don't like how these icons look, this guide shows how you can modify their appearance.
We assume that you know how to [use CSS snippets in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles#Use+Themes+and+or+CSS+snippets).
As you see, the default buttons are colorful which some people may find distracting. If you prefer monochrome buttons, you can simply convert the buttons to grayscale via [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-buttons-gray.css):
```
.tasks-edit, .tasks-postpone {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
}

```

This gives us this result:
![Task buttons with gray style](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/tasks-buttons-gray.png)
Or you can use alternative characters instead, which are monochromatic by default, like in [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-buttons-alt.css):
```
.tasks-edit::after {
    content: '\1f589';
}

.tasks-postpone::after {
    content: '\2bee';
}

```

This would look like so:
![Task buttons with alt characters](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/tasks-buttons-alt.png)
Note that the unicode characters used here are from Unicode version 7 and 8 and may not yet be supported on all platforms. If you want to support more platforms, you should choose characters from Unicode 6 that are more widely available.
If you want to make the buttons look more like real buttons and give them some color, this is also possible, like in [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-buttons-stylish.css):
```
.tasks-edit::after {
    content: '\1f58b';
}

.tasks-postpone::after {
    content: '\1f4a4';
}

.tasks-edit, .tasks-postpone {
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffda89, #ffa07a);
    padding: 2px 5px;
    border-radius: var(--radius-s);
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

```

This example snippet result in the follow style:
![Task buttons with more style](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/tasks-buttons-stylish.png)
This section shows how to recreate the pre-Tasks 6.0.0 appearance of the Edit button.
You can also use your own graphics instead of existing unicode characters, like in [this example CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-buttons-svg.css):
```
.tasks-edit, .tasks-postpone {

    margin-left: .66em;

}

.tasks-edit::after, .tasks-postpone::after {

}

```

The CSS snippet above shows the buttons with a similar look as in earlier versions of Tasks:
![Task buttons with old style](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/tasks-buttons-svg.png)
When using graphics, it is also guaranteed that the icons look the same on all platforms.
And finally, if you prefer simple text-based buttons which would look more like links, then [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-buttons-text.css) shows how to do it:
```
.tasks-edit, .tasks-postpone {
    font-size: var(--font-ui-smaller);
    font-variant: small-caps;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-left: 1em;
}

.tasks-edit::after {
    content: '[edit]';
}

.tasks-postpone::after {
    content: '[move]';
}

```

The CSS snippet above results in the following style:
![Task buttons with text style](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/tasks-buttons-text.png)

publish: true
```

Released
  * Introduced in Tasks 1.18.0.
  * Support for filenames exactly matching a custom format added in 7.6.0.


You can automatically set a scheduled date for tasks based on the name of their files. This feature can be enabled in the settings, via the option `Use filename as Scheduled date for undated tasks`. Changing this requires a restart of Obsidian.
This allows you, for instance, to make all the tasks in your daily notes be considered as scheduled. You can then query them using the `scheduled` and `happens` [filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters).
Example query :
```
```tasks
scheduled before today
group by scheduled
not done
```

```

Seeing implied dates
  * The task is not visually modified in any Obsidian views: the scheduled date is only implied, and not displayed.
  * It will however appear in the [edit dialog](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task).
  * It can also be examined by using the `group by scheduled` instruction in a tasks block.


For the scheduled date to be automatically set from the file name, the following rules apply :
  * the setting 'Use filename as Scheduled date for undated tasks' must be enabled, and Obsidian restarted,
  * the task must have no existing scheduled date, due date or start date,
  *     1. either the file name must **contain** a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYYMMDD`,
    2. or the file name must **exactly equal** an additional date format which has been added using the [additional date format setting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Use+Filename+as+Default+Date#Additional%20date%20format)),
  * the file must be in one of the configured folders or its sub-folders if [that setting is enabled](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Use+Filename+as+Default+Date#Folders%20setting).


Examples of file names that contain the built-in date formats:
```
daily/2022-10-12 Wednesday.md
meetings/rd. 2022-09-07.md
20220612 - random thoughts.md

```

The following image shows the settings relating to this feature:
![Use filename as Scheduled date for undated tasks settings](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-use-filename-for-date.png) Use filename as Scheduled date for undated tasks settings
Released
Introduced in tasks 7.6.0.
By default, only the date formats `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYYMMDD` will be matched.
This setting allows you to specify an additional date format to be matched for this feature.
Warning
Note that unlike the `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYYMMDD` date formats, this setting does not support prefixes or suffixes in file names at this time. The custom additional date format must be an exact match to the file.
So if the additional format is `MMM D YYYY`:
  * A file `Jan 4 2024.md` would be detected as the date `2024-01-04`.
  * A file `Notes from Jan 4 2024.md` wouldn't be recognised as having a date.


See the [syntax reference](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) for supported date formats.
Example 1
If you have a daily note in `daily/Jun 20 2024`, then you could use the date format `MMMM Do YYYY` to automatically set tasks within that file as scheduled on that date.
Example 2
If your Daily Notes core plugin settings specifies a Date format with folders:
```
YYYY/MM/dddd, MMMM Do YYYY

```

Then you would want to put this text in as the additional filename date format:
```
dddd, MMMM Do YYYY

```

Example 3 - Weekly notes
If you use Weekly notes, you can specify the format of the weekly note name, and then Tasks will select the first day of the week as the default scheduled date. For example, if using typical weekly note names like `2024-W49`:
```
YYYY-[W]ww

```

If the `Folders with default Scheduled dates` field is left empty in the settings dialog, default dates are applied to un-dated tasks all the files in the vault.
A comma-separated list of folders can be entered to limit the scope. Default dates will then only be applied to undated tasks in all files in the specified folders and their subfolders.
Examples:
Folders setting | Matching files | Not matching  
---|---|---  
(empty) |  `20221022.md`  
`daily/20221012.md` |   
`daily` |  `daily/2022-10-12.md`  
`daily/notes/2022-10-12.md` |  `20221022.md`  
`meetings/2022-10-12.md`  
`daily,prj/daily` |  `daily/2022-10-12.md`  
`prj/daily/2022-10-12.md`  
`prj/daily/notes/2022-06-12.md` |  `20221022.md`  
`meetings/2022-10-12.md`  
Warning
Folders with a comma (`,`) in their name are not supported.
Folders with a comma (`,`) in their name are not supported.
Unlike the `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYYMMDD` date formats, if an additional custom date format is provided, it will not support prefixes or suffixes and will only match files following the exact format provided.

[#index-pages](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/About+Queries#index-pages)
You can list tasks from your entire vault by querying them using a `tasks` code block. You can edit the tasks from the query results by clicking on the little pencil icon next to them. Tasks are by default sorted by status, due date, and then path. You can change the sorting (see query options below).
The simplest way to query tasks is this:
```
```tasks
```

```

In Live Preview and Reading modes, this will list _all_ tasks from your vault, regardless of their properties like status.
This is probably not what you want. Therefore, Tasks allows you to set query options to filter the tasks that you want to show.
For instance, you can show only the tasks (from anywhere in the vault) that are due today:
```
## Due today
```tasks
due today
not done
```

```

You can create as many task queries as you like, and you can also wrap them into [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts) if you want to style them differently:
```
> [!check] Due today
> ```tasks
> due today
> not done
> ```

```

In the following sections we will explain all the various options that are available for querying tasks.
  * [Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters)
    * Control which tasks are shown in Tasks Queries.
  * [Explaining Queries](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Explaining+Queries)
    * Get Tasks to show how your query is interpreted, so you can check your instructions.
  * [Comments](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Comments)
    * Write notes to your future self, explaining your Queries.
  * [Examples](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Examples)
    * A selection of some of the more commonly used search instructions.


  * [Global Query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query)
    * Set a global query in the settings that Tasks will add to the start of all the Queries in your vault.
  * [Presets](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Presets)
    * Define named instructions that you can re-use in multiple queries throughout your whole vault.
  * [Query File Defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults)
    * Set properties in note frontmatter, to instruct tasks to add instructions to all the Queries in that file.


The Query is assembled like this:
  1. **Global Query** , from settings. 
     * This will be discarded if `ignore global query` is present in any of the following locations.
  2. Append the **Query File Defaults** , based on the Query file's properties.
  3. Append the **Query Source** , from the `tasks` block.


Later [Layout](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout) instructions will override earlier ones.
  * [Combining Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Combining+Filters)
    * How to use `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.
    * Warning: Make sure you understand where to place brackets in these instructions!
  * [Regular Expressions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Regular+Expressions)
    * A complex but powerful alternative to simple text searches.
  * [Line Continuations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations)
    * Break long instructions up across multiple lines for readability.


  * [Backlinks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Backlinks)
    * Navigate from tasks in Queries back to the source Markdown line.


  * [Limiting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Limiting)
    * Control the maximum number of tasks displayed in a Query's results, and in each group of tasks.
  * [Sorting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Sorting)
    * Define the sort order.
  * [Grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Grouping)
    * Define headings to group tasks.
  * [Layout](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout)
    * Hide and show individual elements of the Query results.


Released
The ability to use capital letters in query instructions was introduced in Tasks 5.2.0.
Almost all Tasks query instructions are now case-INsensitive: they can now be typed with capital letters. This is especially helpful when typing them on mobile phones, and for emphasising important words.
For example, the following instructions are identical:
  * `due before tomorrow`
  * `Due before tomorrow`
  * `due BEFORE Tomorrow`


The only exceptions to this flexibility are:
  * When [Combining Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Combining+Filters), the boolean operators such as `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` must still be capitalised.
  * In [Regular Expressions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Regular+Expressions), the search pattern and flags are still case-sensitive.
  * The code in expressions in [Custom Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Filters), [Custom Sorting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Sorting) and [Custom Grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Grouping) remain case-sensitive.


If a query gives unexpected results, see [Explaining Queries](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Explaining+Queries) and add the `explain` instruction.
By default, the result list will list tasks unindented.
Tip
Use the `show tree` instruction to indent tasks and list items in query results. See [Hide and Show Tree](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout#Hide%20and%20Show%20Tree).
![Sample search results with 'show tree' instruction](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/show-tree.png) Sample search results with 'show tree' instruction

  * ["scope: sub-tasks and super-tasks" Issues](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22scope%3A%20sub-tasks%20and%20super-tasks%22%20is%3Aissue%20)

Warning
The result list will not contain any footnotes of the original task. The footnotes will _not_ be carried over to documents with ```tasks blocks. We are tracking this in [issue #2571](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2571).

Released
Introduced in Tasks 1.19.0.
The `explain` instruction adds some extra output at the start of the search results, when tasks blocks are viewed in Live Preview and Reading modes.
This has a number of benefits:
  *     * Any dates in filters are expanded, to show the actual dates used in the search.
  *     * Combinations of queries (via `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` etc) can be seen more clearly.
  * [global filter](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Global+Filter) enabled, it is included in the explanation. 
    * This often explains why tasks are missing from results.
  * If there is a [global query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query) enabled, it too is included in the explanation.
  * Any [query file defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults)-generated instructions are listed (since Tasks 7.15.0).
  * Any ['group by'](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Grouping) instructions are listed (since Tasks 5.4.0).
  * Any ['sort by'](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Sorting) instructions are listed (since Tasks 5.4.0).


For example, when the following text is placed in a tasks query block:
```
starts after 2 years ago
scheduled after 1 week ago
due before tomorrow
explain

```

the results begin with the following, on `2022-10-21`:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  starts after 2 years ago =>
    start date is after 2020-10-21 (Wednesday 21st October 2020) OR no start date

  scheduled after 1 week ago =>
    scheduled date is after 2022-10-14 (Friday 14th October 2022)

  due before tomorrow =>
    due date is before 2022-10-22 (Saturday 22nd October 2022)

```

Note how it shows the dates being searched for very clearly, including the day of the week.
It also shows that `starts` searches also match tasks with not start date.
Released
Introduced in Tasks 4.3.0.
For example, when the following [regular expression](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Regular+Expressions) is placed in a tasks query block:
```
explain
path regex matches /^Root/Sub-Folder/Sample File\.md/i

```

the results begin with the following:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  path regex matches /^Root/Sub-Folder/Sample File\.md/i =>
    using regex:     '^Root\/Sub-Folder\/Sample File\.md' with flag 'i'

```

For example, when the following text is placed in a tasks query block:
```
explain
not done
(due before tomorrow) AND (is recurring)

```

the results begin with the following, on `2022-10-21`:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  not done

  (due before tomorrow) AND (is recurring) =>
    AND (All of):
      due before tomorrow =>
        due date is before 2022-10-22 (Saturday 22nd October 2022)
      is recurring

```

With complex Boolean combinations of filters, it is easy to get parentheses in the wrong place, even when using [Line Continuations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations) to improve readability.
With `explain`, the interpreted logic is easily visible.
For example, when the following text is placed in a tasks query block:
```
explain
(                                                                                       \
    (description includes 1) AND (description includes 2) AND (description includes 3)  \
) OR (                                                                                  \
    (description includes 5) AND (description includes 6) AND (description includes 7)  \
)                                                                                       \
AND NOT (description includes 7)

```

the results begin with the following, on `2022-10-21`:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  (                                                                                       \
      (description includes 1) AND (description includes 2) AND (description includes 3)  \
  ) OR (                                                                                  \
      (description includes 5) AND (description includes 6) AND (description includes 7)  \
  )                                                                                       \

        description includes 2
        description includes 3
      AND (All of):
        AND (All of):
          description includes 5
          description includes 6
          description includes 7
        NOT:
          description includes 7

```

Released
The Global Query setting was added in Tasks 3.5.0.
For example, with this [global query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query):
```
limit 50
heading includes tasks

```

and when the following text is placed in a tasks query block:
```
not done
due next week
explain

```

the results begin with the following, on `2022-10-21`:
```
Explanation of the global query:

  heading includes tasks

  At most 50 tasks.

Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  not done

  due next week =>
    due date is between:
      2022-10-24 (Monday 24th October 2022) and
      2022-10-30 (Sunday 30th October 2022) inclusive

```

Released
The [Query File Defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults) facility was introduced in Tasks 7.15.0.
What are Query File Defaults?
You can use [Query File Defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults) facility to modify Tasks searches, by adding certain pre-defined property value's the query file's frontmatter.
For example, setting `TQ_short_mode` to `true` makes Tasks insert the following line at the start of the query:
```
short mode

```

Consider this Markdown note:
```
---
TQ_extra_instructions: |-
  folder includes {{query.file.folder}}
  not done
TQ_short_mode: true
TQ_show_tree: true
---

```tasks
explain
```

```

The Tasks results begin would the following:
```
Explanation of the Query File Defaults (from properties/frontmatter in the query's file):

  folder includes {{query.file.folder}} =>
  folder includes Test Data/

  not done

  short mode

  show tree

Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  No filters supplied. All tasks will match the query.

```

Released
Placeholders were introduced in Tasks 4.7.0.
For example, when the following query with [Query Properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Query+Properties) in [placeholders](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Placeholders) is placed in a tasks query block in the file `some/sample/file path.md`:
```
explain
path includes {{query.file.path}}
path includes {{query.file.pathWithoutExtension}}
root includes {{query.file.root}}
folder includes {{query.file.folder}}
filename includes {{query.file.filename}}
filename includes {{query.file.filenameWithoutExtension}}

description includes Some Cryptic String {{! Inline comments are removed before search }}

```

the results begin with the following:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  path includes {{query.file.path}} =>
  path includes some/sample/file path.md

  path includes {{query.file.pathWithoutExtension}} =>
  path includes some/sample/file path

  root includes {{query.file.root}} =>
  root includes some/

  folder includes {{query.file.folder}} =>
  folder includes some/sample/

  filename includes {{query.file.filename}} =>
  filename includes file path.md

  filename includes {{query.file.filenameWithoutExtension}} =>
  filename includes file path

  description includes Some Cryptic String {{! Inline comments are removed before search }} =>
  description includes Some Cryptic String

```

For readability, explanations are shown in a fixed-width font (a `PRE` block), and if the text is too wide for the screen a horizontal scrollbar is shown. Otherwise, testing showed that the explanations would be unusable on small-screen devices.
Using a [CSS snippet in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles#Use+Themes+and+or+CSS+snippets), we can change the appearance of the explanation block.
For example, [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-plugin-explain-text-blue.css) `tasks-plugin-explain-text-blue.css` makes the explanation block text blue:
```
/* Make the Tasks plugin's 'explain' output stand out in blue */
.plugin-tasks-query-explanation {
    color: var(--color-blue);
}

```

Released
Introduced in Tasks 1.12.0.
[Regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) ("regex") searches are a powerful alternative to the simple `includes` and `does not include` searches.
Warning
Regular expression (or 'regex') searching is a powerful but advanced feature that requires thorough knowledge in order to use successfully, and not miss intended search results.
It is easy to write a regular expression that looks like it is correct, but which uses a special character that completely changes the meaning of the search string.
For example, `\d` does **not** match the **two** characters `\d`, it matches any **one** of the following characters: `0123456789`.
This documentation gives only a brief overview of the facility, with a few motivating examples, and then links to other resources, for thorough treatment.
Having said that, regex searches are a valuable tool, used in many other tools, and time invested in learning about them can pay off well in future, in many other tools and scenarios.
The components of a regex search filter are:
  1. The field name, for example `description` or `path`
  2. Either `regex matches` or `regex does not match`
  3. `/pc_abigail|pc_edwina|at_work/`
     * That pattern searches for `pc_abigail`, `pc_edwina` or `at_work`, without the need to create a boolean combination of three separate filters
  4. [flag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags) at the end, such as `i`, that can change the meaning of the expression 
     * Note that many of the allowed flags are not relevant in the Tasks context, because there are no multi-line searches or global searches, for example.


Case-sensitive example, showing the components:
```
description regex matches /pc_abigail|pc_edwina|at_work/
^1          ^2            ^3

```

Case-INsensitive example, showing the components:
```
description regex matches /pc_abigail|pc_edwina|at_work/i
^1          ^2            ^3                            ^4

```

  * Regex searches are **case-sensitive** , unlike the simpler `includes` and `does not include`
  * A regex search can be made **insensitive** by appending a `i` flag after the closing `/`, for example: `/I aM cAsE INsensitive because of the LiTle i after the closing slash/i`
  * Tasks does not support multi-line regex searches, as each task is a single line.


To search for any of the characters `[ \ ^ $ . | ? * + ( )` literally in Tasks, you should put a `\` character before each of them.
This is called 'escaping'. See [Escaping, special characters](https://javascript.info/regexp-escaping).
See the next section for the meaning of some of these characters.
Tip
Since Tasks 4.3.0, it is no longer necessary to escape `/` characters as `\/`, although searches will still work if you do escape them.
So these two searches are now identical, and will both search for tasks in any folder that contains `Root/Sub-Folder/Sub-Sub-Folder` anywhere:
```
folder regex matches /Root/Sub-Folder/Sub-Sub-Folder/
folder regex matches /Root\/Sub-Folder\/Sub-Sub-Folder/

```

Released
Introduced in Tasks 4.3.0.
To see how Tasks interpreted your regular expression, you can add an `explain` line to the query.
For example, the results of this query:
```
explain
path regex matches /^Root/Sub-Folder/Sample File\.md/i

```

will have this extra text in an [explanation](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Explaining+Queries) at the start:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  path regex matches /^Root/Sub-Folder/Sample File\.md/i =>
    using regex:     '^Root\/Sub-Folder\/Sample File\.md' with flag 'i'

```

The use of apostrophes (`'`) rather than forward slashes (`/`) in the explanation is intended to emphasise that the delimiting slashes in the query are not included in the search strings.
If using regex searches, it is important to be aware of the available special characters for several reasons:
  1. They enable complex queries to written in simple ways
  2. They can cause confusing results or broken searches, if not "escaped" in the search.


Here are a few examples of the [many special characters](https://javascript.info/regexp-escaping):
  * `.` matches any character
  * `[...]` means search for any of the characters in the square brackets. 
    * For example, `[aeiou]` will match any of an `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` or `u`.
    * See [Sets and ranges [...]](https://javascript.info/regexp-character-sets-and-ranges)
  *     * `^` matches the start of the string (but when `[^inside brackets]`, it means "not")
    * `$` matches the end of the string
    * See [Anchors: string start ^ and end $](https://javascript.info/regexp-anchors)
  * `|` is an `OR` in regular expressions 
    * See [Alternation (OR) |](https://javascript.info/regexp-alternation)
  * `\` adds special meaning to some characters. For example: 
    * `\d` matches one digit, from 0 to 9
    * `\D` matches character that is not a digit
    * See [Character classes](https://javascript.info/regexp-character-classes)


For a thorough, clear introduction to all the options, see [Regular expressions](https://javascript.info/regular-expressions) at JavaScript.info.

  * [Regular expressions](https://javascript.info/regular-expressions) at JavaScript.info
  * [Regex Tutorial](https://regexone.com/)

Online tools for experimenting with - and testing - regular expressions:
  * [Regex Testing Tool: regex101](https://regex101.com/): Select the flavor 'ECMAScript (JavaScript)'


Implementation details:
  * Implemented using [JavaScript's RegExp implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
  * Supports [JavaScript RegExp Flags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags), although not all of them are relevant in this context.


Please be aware of the following limitations in Tasks' implementation of regular expression searching:
  * [Lookahead and Lookbehind](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) searches are untested, and are presumed not to work on Apple mobile devices, or to cause serious performance problems with slow searches.


Below are some example regex searches, to give some ideas of what can be done.
There are some more examples in the [Tasks-Demo sample vault](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/tree/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo), in the file [Regular Expression Searches](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/Filters/Regular%20Expression%20Searches.md).
Find tasks whose description begins with Log, exact capitalisation:
```
description regex matches /^Log/

```

* * *
Find tasks whose description begins with Log, ignoring capitalisation
```
description regex matches /^Log/i

```

I want to find tasks that have no description, perhaps because they were created from a template:
```
description regex matches /^$/

```

I want to exclude tasks with no description:
```
description regex does not match /^$/

```

How this works: in regular expressions, `/^$/` matches text where there is nothing between the start and the end.
I want to find tasks that are waiting for something else. But 'waiting' can be spelled in several different ways:
```
description regex matches /waiting|waits|wartet/i

```

Find tasks containing a time in the description - simple version. This matches invalid times, such as `99:99`, as `\d` means 'any digit'.
```
description regex matches /\d\d:\d\d/

```

* * *
Find tasks containing a time in the description. This is more precise than the previous example, thanks to specifying which digits are allowed in each position.
```
description regex matches /[012][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]/

```

Suppose you wanted to search for tags of this form: `#tag/subtag3/subsubtag5`, where the `3` and the `5` are allowed to be any single digit.
  * We can use either `[0-9]` or `\d` to match a single digit.
  * To find a sub-tag, any `/` characters must be 'escaped' to prevent them truncating the rest of the search pattern.


Escaping the `/` leads us to this instruction, which we have made case-insensitive to find capitalised tags too:
```
tags regex matches /#tag\/subtag[0-9]\/subsubtag[0-9]/i

```

Suppose you wanted to search for tasks with a very short tag in: `#t`, and to not match tags like `#task` and `#t/subtag`.
```
tag regex matches /#t$/i

```

The `$` prevents there being any more characters in the tag after the search pattern.
The `i` makes the search case-insensitive.

Presets allow you to save commonly used task query instructions and reuse them across multiple queries. Instead of repeatedly typing the same complex filters and sorting options, you can define them once in settings and reference them by name.
Released
Introduced in Tasks 7.20.0.
Presets are particularly useful when you:
  * Use the same query patterns frequently.
  * Want to maintain consistent formatting across multiple task views.
  * Need to update search criteria in multiple locations (change once, update everywhere).
  * Use daily notes, all of which share the same task queries.


  1. Open Tasks settings.
  2. Navigate to the "Presets" section.
  3.      * **Name** : A simple identifier (e.g., `my_overdue_tasks`)
     * **Instructions** : One or more valid task query lines


Tip
Any open Tasks queries are reloaded automatically when presets are edited.
There are two ways to use presets in your task queries:
```
preset preset_name

```

For example:
```
preset my_overdue_tasks

```

```
{{preset.preset_name}}

```

For example:
```
{{preset.my_overdue_tasks}}

```

Use the **basic syntax** (`preset name`) for most cases where you want to include complete instruction lines.
Use the **[placeholder](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Placeholders) syntax** (`{{preset.name}}`) when you need to:
  * Include presets within [Boolean query combinations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Combining+Filters) (AND, OR, NOT).
  * Define partial instruction lines, such as expressions for `filter by function`, `sort by function`, or `group by function`.


  * When the requested preset does not exist, Tasks writes out the list of available Presets, with their first line.
  * So for a quick reminder, type `preset xxxx` or any other non-existent Preset name, then switch to Reading or Live Preview modes.


For example, with the [default settings](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Presets#Default%20Presets), using `preset xxxx` would show this in the Tasks search results:
```
Cannot find preset "xxxx" in the Tasks settings
The following presets are defined in the Tasks settings:
  hide_date_fields    : # Hide any values for all date fields...
  hide_everything     : # Hide everything except description and any tags...
  hide_non_date_fields: # Hide all the non-date fields, but not tags...
  hide_query_elements : # Hide postpone, edit and backinks...
  this_file           : path includes {{query.file.path}}
  this_folder         : folder includes {{query.file.folder}}
  this_folder_only    : filter by function task.file.folder === query.file...
  this_root           : root includes {{query.file.root}}

```

As the above example shows, for multi-line presets, it is worth adding a descriptive [comment](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Comments) on their first line (starting with a `#` character), to remind you of their behaviour.
The Tasks plugin defines several useful built-in presets, for demonstration purposes:
Name | Instruction(s)  
---|---  
`this_file` | `path includes {{query.file.path}}`  
`this_folder` | `folder includes {{query.file.folder}}`  
`this_folder_only` | `filter by function task.file.folder === query.file.folder`  
`this_root` | `root includes {{query.file.root}}`  
`hide_date_fields` |  `# Hide any values for all date fields`  
`hide due date`  
`hide scheduled date`  
`hide start date`  
`hide created date`  
`hide done date`  
`hide cancelled date`  
`hide_non_date_fields` |  `# Hide all the non-date fields, but not tags`  
`hide id`  
`hide depends on`  
`hide recurrence rule`  
`hide on completion`  
`hide priority`  
`hide_query_elements` |  `# Hide postpone, edit and backinks`  
`hide postpone button`  
`hide edit button`  
`hide backlinks`  
`hide_everything` |  `# Hide everything except description and any tags`  
`preset hide_date_fields`  
`preset hide_non_date_fields`  
`preset hide_query_elements`  
These defaults can, of course, be edited, renamed and deleted.
A common use case is creating presets for daily notes.
Tip
The following presets work when the daily note's file name matches the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD`.
**Preset name** : `overdue_tasks` **Instructions** :
```
not done
happens before {{query.file.filenameWithoutExtension}}
group by function task.happens.format('YYYY-MM')

```

Then use in your daily note:
```
```tasks
preset overdue_tasks
```

```

**Preset name** : `today_tasks` **Instructions** :
```
not done
happens {{query.file.filenameWithoutExtension}}

```

Then use in your daily note:
```
```tasks
preset today_tasks
```

```

The placeholder syntax allows presets to be used within Boolean query combinations:
```
({{preset.work_tasks}}) AND ({{preset.high_priority}})

```

You can create presets that define partial instruction lines for use with function-based queries:
**Preset name** : `filter_home_context` **Instructions** :
```
task.tags.some(tag => tag.includes('#context/home'))

```

**Usage** :
```
filter by function {{preset.filter_home_context}}

```

This approach is particularly useful for complex filter expressions that you want to reuse across multiple queries.
  * Preset names should not contain spaces or special characters.
  * When using basic syntax (`preset name`), presets must contain complete, valid instruction lines.
  * When using placeholder syntax (`{{preset.name}}`), presets can contain partial instruction lines.
  * Presets are applied exactly as written and cannot be modified when used.
  * The basic syntax (`preset name`) cannot be used within Boolean query combinations.

```

Released
  * Introduced in Tasks 5.0.0.
  * **Important** : This facility changed the meaning of a final backslash (`\`) character on a query line. See [Appendix Updating pre-5.0.0 searches with trailing backslashes](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations#Appendix%20Updating%20pre-5.0.0%20searches%20with%20trailing%20backslashes) below to update queries.


In Tasks code blocks, **a backslash (`\`)** is a 'line continuation character'. If a backslash is placed at the end of a line, the line is considered to continue on the next line.
This is useful for dividing up long queries across multiple lines, for better readability.
For example this query:
```
(priority is highest) OR       \
    (priority is lowest)
explain

```

... runs this search:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  (priority is highest) OR       \
      (priority is lowest)
   =>
  (priority is highest) OR (priority is lowest) =>
    OR (At least one of):
      priority is highest
      priority is lowest

```

This facility will be helpful for long [Combining Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Combining+Filters), [Custom Sorting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Sorting), and [Custom Grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Grouping) lines, and other queries that may be difficult to read on one line.
There are some more realistic examples towards the end of the [Due date custom grouping examples](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Grouping#Due%20Date).
Points to note:
  * To be a continuation character, the `\` must be the **very last character** on the line.
  * All the `\` and all whitespace around it is compressed down to a single space.
  * Consider indenting the second and subsequent lines, so the structure of the query is immediately clear.
  * Consider aligning the `\` characters for readability.
  * If in doubt, add the `explain` instruction to inspect how your code block is interpreted.


In Tasks code blocks, **two backslashes (`\\`) at the very end of a line** are treated as a **single backslash**.
This enables searching in the rare case that a trailing backslash is needed for a query.
For example this query:
```
# Search for a single backslash:
description includes \\
explain

```

... runs this search:
```
Explanation of this Tasks code block query:

  description includes \\ =>
  description includes \

```

Points to note:
  * `\` to prevent it being continuation character. 
    * This is risky though, as some editors and linters remove unnecessary trailing spaces.
    * So the **two backslashes option is safer**.
  * If in doubt, add the `explain` instruction to inspect how your code block is interpreted.


Warning
In Tasks 5.0.0 the meaning of a **final backslash (`\`) character** on a query line changed **from** :
  * `search for a backslash character`


**to:**
  * `join the next query line to this one`


To retain the previous search behaviour, use `\\` at the end of query lines instead of `\`.
For example:
Old instruction | Use this instruction instead  
---|---  
`description includes something\` | `description includes something\\`  
For details, see [Searches needing a trailing backslash](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations#Searches%20needing%20a%20trailing%20backslash) in [Line Continuations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations).

You can hide and show individual elements of the rendered list with the "hide" and "show" commands together with the name of the element.
Released
The `show` commands were introduced in Tasks 1.14.0.
The following task elements exist:
  * `id`
  * `depends on`
  * `priority`
  * `cancelled date`
  * `created date`
  * `start date`
  * `scheduled date`
  * `due date`
  * `done date`
  * `recurrence rule`
  * `on completion`
  * `tags`


All of these task elements are shown by default, so you will use the command `hide` if you do not want to show any of them.
For example:
```
hide created date

```

Released
  * `created date` was introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.
  * `tags` was introduced in Tasks 4.1.0.
  * `cancelled date` was introduced in Tasks 5.5.0.
  * `id` and `depends on` were introduced in Tasks 6.1.0.


About `hide tags`
  1. `hide tags`. 
     * Tasks is a bit more relaxed in recognising tags than Obsidian. For example, `#123` is treated as a tag by Tasks, and so is included in Tasks' searches, sorting and grouping code.
     * However, `#123` is [not recognised as a valid Obsidian tag](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags#Tag+format) and so not hidden.
     * See [Tags > Recognising Tags](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Tags#Recognising%20Tags) for more information.
  2. [discussion #848](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/848). 
     * However, you can hide individual tags in Tasks search results with CSS snippets: see [this comment](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/848#discussioncomment-12117010).


The following query elements exist:
  * `tree`
  * `edit button`
  * `postpone button`
  * `backlink`
  * `urgency`
  * `task count`


Released
  * `urgency` was introduced in Tasks 1.14.0.
  * `tree` was introduced in Tasks 7.12.0.


All of these query elements except `urgency` and `tree` are shown by default, so you will use the command `hide` if you do not want to show any of them, or the command `show` to show the urgency score or tree view.
For example:
```
hide task count

```

Tip
The new instruction `show tree` is the first in a long series of steps to teach the Tasks plugin to fully handle [nested tasks and list items](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Nesting+lists).
When you use `show tree`, Tasks shows all found tasks, and **all** their nested tasks and list items (for now, regardless of whether or not the nested tasks matched the query).
Released
`show tree` was introduced in Tasks 7.12.0.
Suppose you have a note called `Party Planner`, with the following list:
```
- [ ] Have a party
    - Planning
        - [x] Decide who to invite ✅ 2024-10-26
        - [ ] Send out the invites
    - Preparation
        - [ ] Plan the menu
            - **Remember Sam's dietary requests**
        - [ ] Buy the food
    - On the day
        - [ ] Prepare the food
        - [ ] Tidy up

```

And you have this Tasks query:
```
```tasks
not done
filename includes Party Planner

show tree
hide backlink
```

```

The `show tree` instruction enables us to see the parent/child relationships in the tasks, and their nested tasks and list items:
![Sample search results with 'show tree' instruction](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/show-tree.png) Sample search results with 'show tree' instruction
Warning
If using `show tree`, please be aware of its current behaviour, detailed below.
We are releasing this first version, having found to already be valuable in our own vaults.
  * **all child tasks and list items are displayed** , regardless of whether they match the query. 
    * In the screenshot above, `Decide who to invite` did not match the `not done` query, but it is still shown.
  * **sorting instructions only affect the sorting of the left-most tasks** in the results list. 
    * Child tasks and list items are displayed in the order that they appear in the file. They are not affected by any `sort by` instructions.
  * **tree layout is turned off by default** , whilst we explore how it should interact with the filtering instructions. 
    * We hope to make it the default behaviour in a future release.


Multiple show and hide instructions can be used in a query, each on a separate line.
For example:
```
```tasks
no due date
path includes GitHub

hide recurrence rule
hide task count
hide backlink
show urgency
```

```

In full mode, query results will show the emojis and the concrete recurrence rule or dates.
This is the default mode.
The command is `full mode`.
Example:
```
```tasks
not done
full mode
```

```

This can be reversed with [Short Mode](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout#Short%20Mode).
In short mode, query results will only show the emojis, but not the concrete recurrence rule or dates. You can hover over the task to see the rule and dates in a tooltip.
The command is `short mode`.
Example:
```
```tasks
not done
short mode
```

```

This can be reversed with [Full Mode](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout#Full%20Mode).
Released
[Query File Defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults) were introduced in Tasks 7.15.0.
All the layout instructions in this page can be generated for you automatically, by putting certain file properties (called 'Query File Defaults') in the file containing the query.
For example, suppose the file containing our query begins with the following:
```
---
TQ_short_mode: true
---

```

All Tasks code blocks in that file will then have this content automatically inserted at their start:
```
short mode

```

And of course, if `TQ_short_mode` were `false`, the following would be inserted:
```
full mode

```

```
publish: true
```

Released
The Global Query setting was added in Tasks 3.5.0.
Global Query is a powerful and flexible alternative to the [Global Filter](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Global+Filter).
You can set a global query in the settings that Tasks will add to the start of all the Queries in your vault.
Example
With a global query set to `path includes /tasks`, the following task block:
```
```tasks
tags include work
```

```

will run as if it were:
```
```tasks
path includes /tasks
tags include work
```

```

If you need to ignore the Global Query in a given Tasks block you may add `ignore global query` instruction to any place of the block.
For example, this allows you to have your task searches ignore certain folders by default. And then in a few searches, you can enable searching for tasks in those folders.
Example
```
tags include work
ignore global query

```

Note
Any use of `ignore global query` inside the Global Query itself is harmless, but ignored.
Released
The `ignore global query` instruction was added in Tasks 4.6.0.
Currently, any query that is allowed in a task block will also work as your Global Query. This feature is especially useful for applying [filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters) or [layout options](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout) by default for all your queries.
Warning
It isn't always possible to override a filter set in the Global Query. We are tracking this in [issue #2074](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2074).
###  [Layout](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout)
Example
**Turn on short mode**
```
```tasks
short mode
```

```

Info
You can override this in a task block using `full mode`
Example
**Hide priority**
```
```tasks
hide priority
```

```

Info
You can override this in a task block using `show priority`
Example
**Show up to 50 tasks**
```
```tasks
limit 50
```

```

Info
You can override this in a task block by specifying a new limit in that task block
###  [Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters)
Example
**Only show tasks under specific headings**
```
```tasks
heading includes Task
```

```

Example
**Exclude tasks from a specific path**
```
```tasks
path regex does not match /^_templates/
```

```

The following setting in the [Tasks Options pane](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Settings) controls the vault's global query:
![Image of the settings options for the global query, showing the default settings.](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/settings-global-query.png)
Changing the global query should take effect without restarting Obsidian, but open queries may need to be refreshed.

Released
Introduced in Tasks 7.15.0.
This is a somewhat specialised facility that enables you to:
  1. **Modify[layout](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout) options in a Tasks Query without editing the `tasks` code block source.**
     * This could save you switching repeatedly between Reading and Editing modes.
     * Perhaps you usually like to see your Tasks search results with certain [Layout](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout) options, but sometimes it is nice to see more detail, perhaps turning `show tree` on and off, depending on your mood.
  2. **Automatically insert one or more instructions in to all the`tasks` code blocks in a file.**
     * You have multiple Tasks queries in a Markdown file, and they have a lot of text in common.
     * You would like to avoid repeating those common instructions in each one, because keeping them consistent is tedious and error-prone.
  3. **Remind yourself what all`tasks` code blocks in a file do.**
     * Quickly turn [explain](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Explaining+Queries) on and off, for when you need a reminder, or are wondering why some tasks are not included in a search.


**Query File Defaults** are like the [Global Query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query) only more specific:
  *     * applies to **all queries in the vault** ,
    * is defined in the **Tasks Settings**.
  *     * apply to **all queries in a file** ,
    * is defined in **one or more standard[named properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Supported%20Query%20File%20Defaults%20property%20values) at the start of the file**.


Structure of this page:
  * This page uses [examples](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#examples) to demonstrate the mechanism.
  * It then shows how to easily adjust a file's Query File Defaults using the [Obsidian-native user interface](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Obsidian-native%20user%20interface) and a [Meta Bind user interface](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Meta%20Bind%20user%20interface).
  * Finally, it gives [technical details](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#technical%20details) and records [limitations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Limitations%20of%20Query%20File%20Defaults).


These examples are provided to demonstrate how Query File Defaults work, so that all the supported values ([listed below](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Supported%20Query%20File%20Defaults%20property%20values)) should make sense.
Any number of Tasks instructions can be inserted at the start of all queries in a file, using the `TQ_extra_instructions` property:
```
---
TQ_extra_instructions: |-
  not done
  group by filename
---

```

When editing `TQ_extra_instructions` in Obsidian's File properties editor, you can press `<Shift> + <Return>` to insert a new line.
Tip
  * `TQ_extra_instructions` is especially useful when you have more than one Tasks search block in a file, and you want the same instructions to be present in all the searches.
  * Before this feature, if those standard instructions changed, you had to remember to update every search.
  * Now you can put those standard instructions in `TQ_extra_instructions`, and only update them in one place.
  * Since Tasks 7.20.0, `TQ_extra_instructions` does support [Line Continuations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations).


Note
The `TQ_extra_instructions` property isn't an array. It's a single string value, and the `|-` allows it to span multiple lines.
Suppose the file containing our query begins with the following:
```
---
TQ_short_mode: true
---

```

Any Tasks code blocks in that file will then have this content inserted at the start:
```
short mode

```

All possible behaviours of `TQ_short_mode`:
`TQ_short_mode` value | Generated instruction  
---|---  
`true` | `short mode`  
`false` | `full mode`  
_no value_ | _no instruction_  
Suppose the file containing our query begins with the following:
```
---
TQ_show_tree: true
---

```

Any Tasks code blocks in that file will then have this content inserted at the start:
```
show tree

```

All possible behaviours of `TQ_show_tree`:
`TQ_show_tree` value | Generated instruction  
---|---  
`true` | `show tree`  
`false` | `hide tree`  
_no value_ | _no instruction_  
You can use the Obsidian **File properties** view to customise Tasks searches:
![Obsidian's 'File properties' widget, with checkboxes and a text box to modify query file defaults for a file containing Tasks searches.](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/query-file-defaults-file-properties-controls.png) Obsidian's **File properties** widget, with checkboxes and a text box to modify query file defaults for a file containing Tasks searches. See [Widening property names in Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Widening%20property%20names%20in%20Obsidian) for the CSS snippet used to widen property names.
To try this out:
  1. `File properties` panel: 
     * Enable the Obsidian core Properties view plugin: `Settings` > `Core plugins` > turn on `Properties view`
     * Switch to Reading or Live Preview modes.
     * Run the `Properties view: Show file properties` command.
  2. `TQ_*` properties to the file 
     * Click on `Add property`.
     * Start typing `TQ_`, or any part of the property names list in [Supported Query File Defaults property values](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults#Supported%20Query%20File%20Defaults%20property%20values) below.
     * Press `<Return>` or `<Enter>` to add the property.
  3. Now you can modify these `TQ_*` properties to change the behaviour of all the Tasks searches in this file.


Tip
Use the command **Tasks: Add all Query File Defaults properties** to add all the available `TQ_*` properties to the active note in one simple step.
By default, the property names are very narrow in Obsidian.
You can make them wider with the following CSS Snippet.
```
/* Make property labels wider, to fit the names of Tasks-specific properties */
.metadata-content {
    --metadata-label-width: 14em;
}

```

The Obsidian user guide shows how to [use CSS snippets in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles#Use+Themes+and+or+CSS+snippets).
See [Make a query user interface](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/Make+a+query+user+interface) for how to use Query File Defaults with the [Meta Bind Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Other+Plugins/Meta+Bind+Plugin) to create a User Interface to easily customise many aspects of your Tasks searches:
![Meta Bind widgets to edit Query File Defaults](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/query-file-defaults-meta-bind-controls.png) Meta Bind widgets to edit Query File Defaults
These are all the properties currently supported by Tasks, as Query File Defaults.
```

---

```

Tip
Use the command **Tasks: Add all Query File Defaults properties** to add all these properties to the active note.
These are all the types of properties currently supported by Tasks, as Query File Defaults.
The `type` values are explained in the [Property types](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties#Property+types) section of Obsidian Help.
Tip
The Tasks plugin automatically adds these properties to the Obsidian vault.
```
{
  "types": {
    "TQ_explain": "checkbox",
    "TQ_extra_instructions": "text",
    "TQ_short_mode": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_backlink": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_cancelled_date": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_created_date": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_depends_on": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_done_date": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_due_date": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_edit_button": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_id": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_on_completion": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_postpone_button": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_priority": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_recurrence_rule": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_scheduled_date": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_start_date": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_tags": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_task_count": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_tree": "checkbox",
    "TQ_show_urgency": "checkbox"
  }
}

```

  * **Canvas cards** cannot use [Query File Defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults), because the [Canvas format](https://jsoncanvas.org) does not support frontmatter/properties. 
    * The workaround is to use the Canvas [Convert to file](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas#Add+text+cards) facility to convert cards which contain Tasks queries to a separate Markdown note, embedded in the canvas.
    * You can then add Query File Defaults to the new note.

You can limit the total number of tasks to show as query results.
Use the query string `limit to <number> tasks`. This will only list the first `<number>` results of the query (after sorting).
Shorthand is `limit <number>`.
You can also limit the allowed number of tasks in each group, if [grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Grouping) is used. Otherwise this limit is ignored.
Use the query string `limit groups to <number> tasks`. This will only list the first `<number>` tasks in each group from the results of the query.
Shorthand is `limit groups <number>`.
Note
`limit groups` instructions are ignored if there are no `group by` instructions in the Tasks query.
Released
`limit groups to <number> tasks` was introduced in Tasks 3.8.0.
If either `limit` option prevents any tasks from being displayed in the results, the total number will be shown, for example:
```
50 of 686 tasks

```

Released
Display of the total number of tasks was added in Tasks 4.8.0.

The following instructions are the default sort order, and they are **automatically appended to the end of _every_ Tasks search**:
```
sort by status.type
sort by urgency
sort by due
sort by priority
sort by path

```

It first sorts tasks in the order `IN_PROGRESS`, `TODO`, `DONE`, `CANCELLED` then `NON_TASK` to ensure that actionable tasks appear first, which is important in searches without a filter like `not done`.
Then it sorts by [Urgency](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Urgency), which is a calculated score derived from several Task properties.
The above lines are _always_ appended to the end of any `sort by` instructions supplied by the user. There is no way to disable this.
However, any `sort by` instructions in queries take precedence over these default ones.
Tip
To sort the results of a query differently from the default, you must add at least one `sort by` line to the query. The sort instructions you supply will take priority over the appended defaults.
Adding `sort by` lines to the [Global Query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query) provides a way override to the default sort order for **all** searches (except those that [ignore the global query](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Global+Query#Ignoring%20the%20global%20query)).
You may also find `sort by function task.lineNumber` to be useful to override the default sort order. See [Override the Tasks plugin's default sort order](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Sorting#Override%20the%20Tasks%20plugin's%20default%20sort%20order) below.
Released
`sort by function` was introduced in Tasks 6.0.0.
Tasks provides many built-in sorting options, but sometimes they don't quite do what is wanted by all users.

When copying and pasting text from websites, spaces are sometimes pasted in as `NBSP` characters.
These are generally visible in text editors, but in Obsidian they look like ordinary spaces.
Tasks does not currently treat these characters as spaces, and so emojis and their values may not be read correctly.
We are tracking this in [issue #606](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/606).
See [Tasks Emoji Format > Unicode Variation Selectors](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format#Unicode%20Variation%20Selectors) below.
Tasks does not understand unicode [Variation Selectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_\(Unicode_block\)).
There has been a report of this preventing Tasks from reading the High Priority emoji (⏫) correctly, when added manually.
We are tracking this in [issue #2273](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2273).

[#feature/scripting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Grouping#feature/scripting) [#feature/grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Grouping#feature/grouping)
Released
Custom grouping was introduced in Tasks 4.0.0.
  *     * `group by function task.urgency.toFixed(3)`
    * See [Number property examples](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Grouping#Number%20property%20examples) below for how floating point numbers are treated, if the precision (number of decimal places) is not specified.
  * [Grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Grouping). 
    * Search for `group by function` in that file.
  * **supported tasks properties** in [Task Properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Task+Properties) and [Quick Reference](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Quick+Reference). 
    * A number of properties are only available for custom grouping and filters, and not for built-in grouping instructions.
  * Find all the **supported query properties** in [Query Properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Query+Properties).
  * Learn a bit about how expressions work in [Expressions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Expressions).


The Tasks plugin provides a lot of built-in ways to [group](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Grouping) similar tasks in Tasks query results.
But sometimes the built-in facility just doesn't quite do what you want.
**Custom grouping** allows you to **invent your own naming scheme** to group tasks.
You use the instruction `group by function` and then add a rule, written in JavaScript, to calculate a group name for a task. See the examples below.
The Reference section [Task Properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Task+Properties) shows all the task properties available for use in custom grouping.
The available task properties are also shown in the [Quick Reference](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Quick+Reference) table.
The Reference section [Query Properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Query+Properties) shows all the query properties available for in custom grouping.
Released
  * Query properties and placeholders were introduced in Tasks 4.7.0.
  * Direct access to Query properties was introduced in Tasks 5.1.0.

    * _...and..._
  *     * _...and..._
  * **ever** used the current vault on the current computer/device in **any** of the following Obsidian versions: 
    * Obsidian 1.6.0, 1.6.1, 1.6.2, or 1.6.3


Missing tasks
  *     * **Obsidian 1.6.3** - and likely also 1.6.0, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2 - had a bug that Tasks, dataview and likely other plugins _will_ fail to find some of your tasks.
    * **Obsidian 1.6.4** fixed the bug when files are edited, but still requires manual edits to existing files, to apply the fix.
    * **Obsidian 1.6.5** provides an efficient way to fix a vault's cache for all files: this needs to be done for: 
      * every affected vault,
      * on every device.
  *     * Explains [the cause](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tasks+in+callouts+with+some+Obsidian+1.6.x+versions#The%20cause%20Incorrect%20Obsidian%20metadata%20cache) and [the solution](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tasks+in+callouts+with+some+Obsidian+1.6.x+versions#The%20solution%20Regenerate%20the%20Obsidian%20metadata%20cache).

Here is an example callout with a title:
```
> [!tip] Callouts can have custom titles
> Like this one.

```

Which displays like this:
Callouts can have custom titles
Like this one.
The underlying cause, confirmed in Obsidian 1.6.3, is that Obsidian reported incorrect (too large) line numbers in its [Metadata cache](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/How+Obsidian+stores+data#Metadata+cache) for tasks (and other content) inside callouts with titles. Plugins use that cache to locate tasks and other data.
Metadata cache
In order to provide a fast experience while using the app, Obsidian maintains a local record of metadata about the files in your vault called the **metadata cache**. This metadata powers many things across the app, from the Graph view to the Outline view.
Obsidian keeps this cache in sync with the files in your vault, but it is possible for the data to get out of sync with the underlying files. In the event that this happens to your vault, you can rebuild your metadata cache from the app settings in the _Files and links_ section.
_Source:[Obsidian help](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/How+Obsidian+stores+data#Metadata+cache)_
Obsidian 1.6.5 was released to all users on 25 June 2024. It provides the following mechanism to rebuild to the vault cache.
Tip
Go to the Obsidian settings, then Files and links. In the Advanced section, then rebuild the vault cache. ![Rebuild the vault metadata cache](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/rebuild-vault-metadata.png) Rebuild the vault metadata cache
The metadata is stored locally, and there is effectively a separate cache for each vault. This means that:
  * This rebuilding needs to be done in each affected vault.
  * And for vaults that are synchronised across devices, it will need to be done on every device.


The following task in a callout will **not be found** by Tasks in Obsidian 1.6.3:
```
> [!NOTE] Some Title - Remove me to make the task be found
> - [ ] Task in callout

```

The underlying cause is that Obsidian 1.6.3 reports incorrect (too large) line numbers in its [cache](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/TypeScript+API/CachedMetadata) for tasks (and other content) inside callouts with titles. Plugins use that cache to locate tasks and other data.
Each nested callout seems to increase the discrepancy in line numbers. So in the following, only `Correction4` would be found:
```
 > [!Calendar]+ MONTH
 >> [!Check]+ GROUP
 >>> [!Attention]+ Correction TITLE
 >>> Some stuff goes here
 >>> - [ ] Correction1
 >>> - [ ] Correction2
 >>> - [ ] Correction3
 >>> - [ ] Correction4

```

We wrote up the underlying Obsidian issue in: [Tasks inside callouts have incorrect positions in the cache](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/tasks-inside-callouts-have-incorrect-positions-in-the-cache/84057/1).
Note
We think it's likely the issue was also present in earlier 1.6.x versions, but we don't know for sure.
Obsidian 1.6.4 beta/insider version was released to those with [Catalyst licences](https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Catalyst+license) on 20 June 2024.
The [Obsidian 1.6.4 changelog](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2024-06-20-desktop-v1.6.4/) reported some fixes to checkboxes and callouts.
However, on initial testing we found that the missing tasks were still not found in many cases.
So it partially fixed the problem, but user intervention was still required to activate the fix in each affected file.
Laborious manual fix, if using Obsidian 1.6.4 and you cannot update to 1.6.5
To ensure Obsidian 1.6.4 finds all your tasks in titled callouts, the Obsidian team has advised:
  * An edit needs to be made anywhere in a file containing any callout with titles, to make Obsidian re-read the file and generate correct line numbers for callout content.
  * After a couple of seconds of inactivity, Obsidian's cached data will be updated, and missing checkboxes in that file will be found correctly.
  * Don't undo the edit, as apparently the cached data would then be reverted.


You will need to do this in all your files that have tasks in titled callouts.
And if the vault is synchronised across multiple devices, you will need to do the above on every device.
The good news is that doing this will then ensure that Obsidian 1.6.4 does now report the correct locations of things inside titled callouts.

[#feature/scripting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Expressions#feature/scripting)
Released
Expressions were introduced in Tasks 4.0.0.
Note
Writing a full explanation of the JavaScript language is outside the scope of this documentation.
We provide some introductory material and some well-thought-out examples to give you ideas, and encourage you to experiment and try the feature out for yourself.
  * Language is JavaScript.
  * The expression is a string instruction.
  * As of Tasks 4.4.0, variables, functions, `if` blocks and similar can be used. See [More complex expressions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Expressions#More%20complex%20expressions).
  * As of Tasks 5.0.0, long expressions can be written over multiple lines thanks to [Line Continuations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations).
  *     * As of Tasks 4.0.0, a single task is passed in, to implement [Custom Grouping](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Grouping).
    * As of Tasks 4.2.0, a single task is passed in, to implement [Custom Filters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Filters).
    * As of Tasks 6.0.0, a single task is passed in, to implement [Custom Sorting](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Sorting).
  * Tasks then calculates a value from the inputs.


The real value of expressions is to calculate values from data in tasks.
In this section, we use artificially simple fixed expressions, to demonstrate the kinds of abilities available.
Each line below is of the form:
```
expression => result

```

Some example expressions:
```
'hello' => 'hello'
"hello" => 'hello'
"" => ''
[] => []
"" || "No value" => 'No value'
false => false
true => true
1 => 1
0 => 0
0 || "No value" => 'No value'
1.0765456 => 1.0765456
6 * 7 => 42
["heading1", "heading2"] => ['heading1', 'heading2']
[1, 2] => [1, 2]
null => null
null || "No value" => 'No value'
undefined => undefined
undefined || "No value" => 'No value'
"I _am_ not _italic_".replaceAll("_", "\\_") => 'I \_am\_ not \_italic\_'

```

Note:
  * Single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are generally equivalent and you can use whichever you prefer.
  * The `||` means 'or'. If the expression to the left of the `||` fails, the expression on the right is used instead.
  * You can experiment with these values by adding them to a `group by function` line in a Tasks query block.
  * If you don't write a `return` statement, Tasks adds one for you.


As of Tasks 4.4.0, it is also possible to use more complex constructs in expressions:
  * `return` statements
  * named variables
  * `if` statements
  * functions


Note in the examples below that if `return` appears anywhere in the expression, you must write your own `return` statement, to prevent the result being `undefined`.
As of Tasks 5.0.0, it is also possible to make longer expressions more readable using [line continuations](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Line+Continuations).
```
return 42
=> 42

const x = 1 + 1; return x * x
=> 4

'any text that contains the word return'
=> undefined

return 'any text that contains the word return'
=> 'any text that contains the word return'

if (1 === 1) { return "yes"; } else { return "no" }
=> 'yes'

function f(value) {                 \
    if (value === 1 ) {             \
        return "yes";               \
    } else {                        \
        return "no";                \
    }                               \
}                                   \
return f(1);
=> 'yes'

```

```

We continually work to improve the Tasks plugin, but at any given time, due to the sheer volume of work, there will always be outstanding requests and known issues.
This page gathers together all the documentation on known limitations of the plugin, in the hope that it will save users from spending time crafting reports for known issues.
Warning
Whenever Tasks behaves in an unexpected way, **please try restarting Obsidian**.
Warning
Tasks only supports **single-line checklist items**.
The task list rendered through this plugin **and** the checklist items from which the task list is built render only the first line of the item. Text after the first line in a multi-line checklist item is ignored (but is unaffected in the stored `.md` file).
This works:
```
-   [ ] This is a task
    -   This is a sub-item
    -   Another sub-item
    -   [ ] And a sub task
        -   Even more details

```

The following _does not work:_
```
-   [ ] This task starts on this line
        and then its description continues on the next line

```

We are tracking this in [issue #2061](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2061).
Tasks can read tasks that are in **numbered lists**.
Released
  * Reading tasks inside numbered lists was introduced in Tasks 1.20.0.
  * Reading tasks inside numbered lists with `)` was introduced in Tasks 7.18.5.


For example:
```
1. [ ] Do first step
2. [ ] Do next step
3. [ ] Do following step

```

or:
```
1) [ ] Do first step
2) [ ] Do next step
3) [ ] Do following step

```

Editing and toggling tasks in numbered lists works fine: the original number is preserved.
Warning
However, when these tasks are displayed in tasks blocks they are displayed as ordinary bullet list items.
This is because they will usually be displayed in a completely different order than in the original list, often mixed in with tasks from bullet lists. The original numbers in this case just don't make sense.
Warning: Obsidian bug in versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.3 has caused some tasks not to be found
See [Missing tasks in callouts with some Obsidian 1.6.x versions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tasks+in+callouts+with+some+Obsidian+1.6.x+versions) for how to make Obsidian 1.6.5 fix its metadata cache, in case it was broken by earlier 1.6.x versions.
Tasks can read tasks that are inside [blockquotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1) or [Obsidian's built-in callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts).
Released
Reading tasks inside callouts and blockquotes was introduced in Tasks 1.11.1
Warning
However, under the following very specific circumstance, Tasks cannot add or remove completion dates or make the next copy of a recurring task:
  * Obsidian is in **Live Preview** editor mode (pencil icon in lower right corner),
  * AND the task's markdown is in a **callout** ,
  * AND the user **clicked on the task's checkbox** to complete or re-open the task.


If you toggle a task's status in this situation, you will see a warning. Use the command `Tasks: Toggle Done`, or switch to Reading View (book icon in lower right corner) to click the checkbox.
Completing a task by clicking its checkbox from a `tasks` query block _will_ work in any editor mode, even if the query is inside a callout.
We are tracking this in [issue #1768](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1768).
Warning
When tasks are in callouts, any preceding heading in the callout is not read by Tasks, so `group by heading` uses the previous heading outside the callout - or `(No Heading)` if none.
We are tracking this in [issue #1989](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1989).
Warning
Tasks cannot read tasks that are in **Obsidian Canvas cards**.
We are tracking this in [issue #2100](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2100).
Warning
Tasks cannot read tasks that are **inside code blocks** , such as the ones used by the **Admonitions plugin**. Use Obsidian's built-in callouts instead.
Obsidian supports two styles of **comments** :
  * `<!-- I am text in a comment -->`
  * `%% I am text in a comment %%`


Warning
By design, Tasks does **not** read any tasks that are inside these comments, because Obsidian does not read them.
Warning
Tasks can only render **inline footnotes**. Regular footnotes are not supported.
```
-   [ ] This is a task^[with a working inline footnote]
-   [ ] This footnote _will not work_[^notworking]

```

See also [About Queries > Footnotes are not displayed in query results](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/About+Queries#Footnotes%20are%20not%20displayed%20in%20query%20results).
Warning
Tasks' support for **blockquotes inside tasks** is limited. It renders correctly, but since Tasks only supports a single line, the meta-data of the task will be inside the blockquote.
Warning
Tasks won't render **spaces around list items** if you have a list with empty lines (typically known as ['loose' lists](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#loose)).
```
-   [ ] First task before the empty line

-   [ ] Another task. The empty line above will _not_ result in the tasks being more spaced out.

```

Warning
Tasks reads task lines **backwards from the end of the line** , looking for metadata emojis with values, tags and block links. As soon as it finds a value that it does not recognise, it stops reading.
This means that you can only put **block links** (`^link-name`) and **tags** after metadata such as dates, priorities, recurrence rules. Anything else will break the parsing of dates, priorities and recurrence rules.
```
-   [ ] Task with priority placed before tag _priority will be recognized_ 🔼 #tag
-   [ ] Task with date placed before tag _date will be recognized_ 📅 2021-04-09 #tag
-   [ ] Task with date placed before other text _date will be not recognized_ 📅 2021-04-09 other text
-   [ ] Task with block link _works_ 📅 2021-04-09 ^e5bebf

```

We are tracking this in [issue #1505](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1505).
If you are concerned that some values in a task are not being parsed as you intended, perhaps because a task is not being found by Tasks searches, you can:
  * view an individual task in the [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task)
  * search for all possible problems: see [Finding unread emojis](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/Find+tasks+with+invalid+data#Finding%20unread%20emojis).


If there are any **Tasks emojis visible in the Description field** , close the modal and delete or move to the left any unrecognised text.
![Create or Edit Modal](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/modal-showing-unparsed-emoji.png)   
The `Tasks: Create or edit` modal showing a due date that was not parsed, due to trailing `other text`.
Warning
Tasks only supports checklist items in markdown files with the file extension `.md`.
  * The date format on task lines is not yet configurable.
  * The only format recognised is `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2024-09-17`.
  * It is not possible to customise the format of date values on task lines.
  * It is also not possible to format dates as links, such as `[[2024-09-17]]`.
  * We are tracking this in [discussion #69](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/69).


  * It is not yet possible to include times on task lines to indicate when they _should_ be acted on.
  * Nor is it possible to record the time when tasks were created, completed or cancelled.
  * We are tracking this in discussions [#607](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/607) and [#668](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/668).


  * The following are out-of-scope for the Tasks plugin: time-tracking, productivity tracking, pomodoros, notifications and similar.
  * We recorded this in [discussion #2721](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/2721).


Adding dependencies:
  * Using the edit task modal, adding lots of dependencies in one step (perhaps 4 or more) can cause an error and some broken dependencies. We are tracking this in [issue #3252](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/3252).


Visualising dependencies:
  * It's not yet possible to directly navigate from a task to the tasks it depends on.
  * Outside of the edit task modal, it is not possible to see the descriptions of the blocking tasks.
  * It is not yet possible to visualise the relationships in any kind of graphical view.


Searching and dependencies:
  * The [Urgency](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Urgency) score does not account for task dependencies. We are tracking this in [issue #2655](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2655).


Dependencies and recurring tasks:
  * [recurring tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks) are completed, the next recurrence will intentionally have any `id` and `dependsOn` values removed. 
    * See [Next recurrence has any dependency fields removed](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks#Next%20recurrence%20has%20any%20dependency%20fields%20removed)


  *     * See [Auto-Suggest > What do I need to know about the order of items in a task?](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Auto-Suggest#What%20do%20I%20need%20to%20know%20about%20the%20order%20of%20items%20in%20a%20task?)
    * We are tracking this in [issue #1505](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1505).
    * See [Finding unread emojis](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/How+To/Find+tasks+with+invalid+data#Finding%20unread%20emojis) to find and fix any tasks with unread emoji values.
  *     * If you select the Dataview format, it will no longer read or write Tasks emoji signifiers.
    * We are tracking this in [issue #1891](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1891).
  * There is no facility in Tasks to convert a vault from one task format to another.


When copying and pasting text from websites, spaces are sometimes pasted in as `NBSP` characters.
These are generally visible in text editors, but in Obsidian they look like ordinary spaces.
Tasks does not currently treat these characters as spaces, and so emojis and their values may not be read correctly.
We are tracking this in [issue #606](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/606).
See [Tasks Emoji Format > Unicode Variation Selectors](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format#Unicode%20Variation%20Selectors) below.
Tasks does not understand unicode [Variation Selectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_\(Unicode_block\)).
There has been a report of this preventing Tasks from reading the High Priority emoji (⏫) correctly, when added manually.
We are tracking this in [issue #2273](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2273).
Essential reading:
  * [About Task Formats > Impact of non-default task formats on Tasks behaviour](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/About+Task+Formats#Impact%20of%20non-default%20task%20formats%20on%20Tasks%20behaviour)
  * [About Task Formats > Limitations of task format support](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/About+Task+Formats#Limitations%20of%20task%20format%20support)


Additional limitations, compared to the Dataview's own parsing of task lines:
  * Tasks cannot yet read Dataview fields arbitrarily anywhere within a task line, even though Dataview allows this.
  *     * It does not yet read fields from [frontmatter](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/#frontmatter).
    * It does not read [inline fields](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/#inline-fields) outside of lines already considered to be tasks.


Folders with a comma (`,`) in their name are not supported.
Unlike the `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYYMMDD` date formats, if an additional custom date format is provided, it will not support prefixes or suffixes and will only match files following the exact format provided.
There are some Auto-Suggest behaviours that might be improved in future releases:
  *     *       * Done Date can be added either with the 'Tasks: Toggle task done' command or by clicking the task's checkbox when in Live Preview or Reading views.
      * Both Done and Cancelled dates can be edited in the [Create or edit Task](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task) modal.
      * We are tracking this in [issue #2863](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2863).
    * `when done`. 
      * This phrase still needs to be typed manually.
      * We are tracking this in [issue #2066](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2066).
  * It currently pops up when editing completed tasks. This may be changed in future.
  * The [date abbreviations offered by "Create or edit task"](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task#Date%20abbreviations) only work after a space is typed.
  * [Kanban plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Other+Plugins/Kanban+Plugin) cards (or any other plugins that use the [auto-suggest integration](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Tasks+Api#Auto-Suggest%20Integration)), the [dependencies](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies) suggestions are not available, because there is not yet a mechanism for plugins to access all the tasks in the vault. 
    * We are tracking this in [issue #3274](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/3274).


The Description field in the 'Create or edit Task' Modal does not yet support Obsidian's Auto Complete facility to help with adding tags, formatting, linking to other notes and so on.
We are tracking this in [issue #1763](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1763).
On phone screens the 'Create or edit Task' Modal may be too tall to fit on the screen. It does support scrolling, and on Android, the scrollbar is visible.
Unfortunately iPhones don't display the scrollbar until you actually start scrolling. Tap on the screen and drag down, and you will see a scrollbar appear temporarily. More importantly, the scrolling does then work fine.
We are tracking the iPhone scrollbar issue in [issue #1238](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1238).
If the [custom hotkey](https://help.obsidian.md/Customization/Custom+hotkeys) for the 'Create or edit Task' Modal is the same as one of the keyboard shortcuts [Keyboard shortcuts](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task#Keyboard%20shortcuts) used in this modal, then when the modal opens, **the keyboard shortcut is unexpectedly also triggered**.
For example, making `Alt + O` (Linux and Windows) or `Ctrl + Opt + O` (Mac) will mean that when the modal opens, the `Lowest` priority is selected, instead of `Normal`.
We are tracking this in [issue #2503](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2503).
One of these reasons:
  * The task status type [status type](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/Status+Types) is `DONE`, `CANCELLED` or `NON_TASK`.
  * The task does has no [due](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Due%20date), [scheduled](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Scheduled%20date) or [start](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Dates#Start%20date) date.
  * The task has at least one date field with an invalid date value.
  * The `hide postpone button` instruction was used.


Currently, no.
Important
To be useful in date-based searches, a recurring task must have at least one of Due, Scheduled or Start dates. The so-called Reference date and the Recurrence rule must appear after the task's description.
Since Tasks 5.0.0, this is enforced by the [Create or edit Task](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task) modal:
![The 'Create or edit Task', with error message saying a date must be set on a recurring task.](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/modal-showing-date-needed-on-recurring-task.png)
_Above: The 'Create or edit Task', with an error message saying a date must be set on a recurring task._
Detail
Technically, you _can_ add a recurrence rule to a task without any dates, and there is nothing stopping anyone editing a task like to give it a recurrence rule but no date.
However, it is not clear that the behaviour is useful, and based on Tasks support requests, it has been seen to confuse a number of users who misunderstand the expected search results.
Here is a recurring task without any dates, that has been completed twice:
```
- [x] Do stuff 🔁 every day ✅ 2023-02-11
- [x] Do stuff 🔁 every day ✅ 2023-02-13
- [ ] Do stuff 🔁 every day

```

These tasks are not searchable by the usual Due, Schedule, Starts or Happens date searches: we believe the majority of Tasks users find their tasks by searching for dates.
Important
Do not use `recurring` on tasks in daily notes, as it would create repeated copies of the task in _each_ daily note.
This is less a limitation of Tasks and more pattern occasionally asked about by users.
When entering repeating tasks into daily notes, the template will create the tasks for each appropriate date. In such cases, these tasks should not be set as recurring.
Repeating tasks can be managed effectively in the following ways:
  * **Either** included in a daily note via a template and set as non-recurring (as each daily note will have its own copy of the task)
  * **Or** placed in a file other than the daily note and set as recurring.


Some users have reported what appears at first glance to be a bug, that when a recurring task is completed, the next instance has any [id](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies#`id`) and [dependsOn](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies#`dependsOn`) fields removed.
This is intentional, but has confused some users, so we explain the reason here.
####  `id`
When initially testing the [Task Dependencies](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies) facility, we found that tasks that were 'blocked by' a recurring task were blocked forever, due to creating a new task with a duplicate `id` that is not `DONE`.
We quickly realised that in order for the dependencies mechanism to work, and not create duplicate `id` values, we needed to remove both `id` and `dependsOn`.
####  `dependsOn`
One way to explain the removal of `dependsOn` in next recurrence is this scenario:
Example
Suppose that every Monday you have to go and buy bread. One day you need to go to the bank to get cash first, so you add a dependency, which will naturally apply to just that one week's task.
Important
There are edge cases for tasks that recur monthly or yearly. For example, a task may be due `2022-01-31` and recur `every 3 months`. The next recurrence date of `2022-04-31` does not exist.
In that case, Tasks moves the next occurrence **backwards** to the next valid date. In this case, that would be `2022-04-30`.
From then on, the due date will be based on the 30th day of the month, unless changed manually. So the next occurrence would happen on `2022-07-30`, even though July has 31 days.
Important
With edge cases for tasks that recur monthly or yearly, **if the rule states the actual date of the next recurrence, Tasks will honour that instruction, skipping recurrence dates that do not exist**.
For example, a task may be due `2022-01-31` and recur `every month on the 31st`. The next recurrence date of `2022-02-31` does not exist.
In that case, Tasks moves the next occurrence **forwards** to the next valid date, skipping over recurrences with invalid dates. In this case, that would be `2022-03-31`.
In the editor there is no direct feedback to whether your recurrence rule is valid. You can validate that tasks understands your rule by using the `Tasks: Create or edit` command when creating or editing a task.
You can _not_ use rules where recurrence happens a certain number of times (`for x times`). Tasks doesn't link the tasks and does not know how often it occurred.
You can _not_ use rules where recurrence ends on a specific date (`until "date"`). There is a bug in [`rrule`](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/rrule) where `until "date"` rules are not converted to the correct text. As a consequence, every subsequent task's "until" date will be one day earlier than the one before. We are tracking this in [issue #1818](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1818).
Important
If the highest priority date in a task does not exist (for example, due date is February 30th), when the task is completed the recurrence rule will disappear, and no new task will be created.
For example, consider the following task:
```
- [ ] Do stuff 🔁 every year 🛫 2024-02-27 ⏳ 2024-02-28 📅 2024-02-30

```

Its highest priority date is the Due date - see [Priority of Dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks#Priority%20of%20Dates) - which is invalid: `2024-02-30`.
When this task is completed, the result will be:
```
- [x] #task Do stuff 🛫 2024-02-27 ⏳ 2024-02-28 📅 Invalid date ✅ 2023-10-21

```

Note that:
  * The recurrence rule has disappeared.
  * No new task has been created.


This is detectable prior to completing the task by viewing the task in Reading Mode:
  * the recurrence rule will be hidden,
  * and the date will be displayed as 'Invalid date'.


  * [‘Create or edit Task’ Modal](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Create+or+edit+Task) does not give any help completing tags as you type them. 
    * We are tracking this in [discussion #229](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/229).
  * If you use a tag for the global filter, do not include it in your searches.
  *     * We are tracking this in [discussion #232](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/232).
    * See [Tags > Using tags in YAML, Frontmatter or file Properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Tags#Using%20tags%20in%20YAML,%20Frontmatter%20or%20file%20Properties) above for a dataview-assisted workaround.


By default, the result list will list tasks unindented.
Tip
Use the `show tree` instruction to indent tasks and list items in query results. See [Hide and Show Tree](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Layout#Hide%20and%20Show%20Tree).
![Sample search results with 'show tree' instruction](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/show-tree.png) Sample search results with 'show tree' instruction

Warning
The result list will not contain any footnotes of the original task. The footnotes will _not_ be carried over to documents with ```tasks blocks. We are tracking this in [issue #2571](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2571).
See also [Getting Started > Tasks with Footnotes](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Getting+Started#Tasks%20with%20Footnotes).
Please be aware of the following limitations in Tasks' implementation of regular expression searching:
  * [Lookahead and Lookbehind](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) searches are untested, and are presumed not to work on Apple mobile devices, or to cause serious performance problems with slow searches.


  * Arrays cannot yet be used as sort keys, as we have not figured out the appropriate way to sort arrays of different lengths.


  * Currently, searching of links is only possible via [custom searches](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/About+Scripting).
  * Tasks does not yet treat [Embeds](https://help.obsidian.md/embeds) as links. This will be fixed soon.
  * Tasks does not yet provide an `inlinks` concept, that is, links _to_ a particular file.
  * `Link.destinationPath` is calculated when the file containing the task is read. 
    * This will either have been during Obsidian startup, or when the file was last modified during the current session.
    * For performance reasons, if files are moved to different folders during an Obsidian session, any tasks that link to the moved files are not updated.
    * The workaround is to run the built-in `Reload app without saving` command.


  * Preset names should not contain spaces or special characters.
  * When using basic syntax (`preset name`), presets must contain complete, valid instruction lines.
  * When using placeholder syntax (`{{preset.name}}`), presets can contain partial instruction lines.
  * Presets are applied exactly as written and cannot be modified when used.
  * The basic syntax (`preset name`) cannot be used within Boolean query combinations.


  * **Canvas cards** cannot use [Query File Defaults](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Query+File+Defaults), because the [Canvas format](https://jsoncanvas.org) does not support frontmatter/properties. 
    * The workaround is to use the Canvas [Convert to file](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas#Add+text+cards) facility to convert cards which contain Tasks queries to a separate Markdown note, embedded in the canvas.
    * You can then add Query File Defaults to the new note.


  *     * There is no visual feedback in the settings pane if there are any duplicates
    * You have to confirm the actually loaded statuses by running the 'Create or edit task' command and looking at the Status drop-down.
  *     * The mechanism to remember which sections were collapsed is not yet working.
  * Usability wise, it would be good if the 'Add New Task Status' button opened the modal to immediately edit the new status.
  * Ideally, the lists of statuses, with their delete and edit buttons, would be a table instead, with the ability to edit the properties directly in the table, instead of having to open up a modal.


Tip
Use [Check your Statuses](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/Check+your+Statuses) to easily find any issues with your Custom Statuses.
  * Currently hitting Return to save changes and close the modal only works if you Tab through all the values until the Checkmark button has focus.


  * It complains about any unrecognised placeholders in comments, even though comments are then ignored.
  *     * but due to [characters with special meanings](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Regular+Expressions#Special%20characters) in regular expressions, it is not recommended to use them.


  * The CSS classes and data attributes described here are **not available for markdown in Source and Live Preview modes**.
  *     * Reading mode,
    * Tasks query blocks in Reading and Live Preview modes.
  * **cannot access any automatic scheduled date** that is created if the [Use Filename as Default Date](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Use+Filename+as+Default+Date) option is enabled. 
    * We are tracking this in [issue #1947](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1947).


If you wish to sort by status, and include tasks which may be complete, this gives misleading results, as old completed tasks will appear first.
The workaround for this is to first sort by [Status Type](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/Status+Types):
```
```tasks
sort by status.type
sort by urgency
```

```

When using [Task Dependencies](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies), blocking tasks should have higher urgency. And blocked tasks should have lower urgency.
This is not yet implemented.
We are tracking this in [issue #2655](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2655).
  *     * It is not yet possible for [auto-suggest](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Auto-Suggest) to add [dependencies](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Task+Dependencies) when Auto-Suggest is used in [Kanban plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Other+Plugins/Kanban+Plugin) cards - or any other plugins that use the [Auto-Suggest Integration](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Tasks+Api#Auto-Suggest%20Integration). We are tracking this in [issue #3274](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/3274).
  *     * It is not yet possible to run Tasks searches via the API. We are tracking this in [issue #2459](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2459).

  - Support and Help/Missing tags, aliases and cssclasses in Obsidian some 1.9.x versions
```

  * **Obsidian 1.9.0 and above** have **breaking changes** that are likely to cause missing `tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses` values. 
    * See [Obsidian 1.9.0 and above read properties strictly](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tags%2C+aliases+and+cssclasses+in+some+Obsidian+1.9.x+versions#Obsidian%201.9.0%20and%20above%20read%20properties%20strictly) and [What needs to change?](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tags%2C+aliases+and+cssclasses+in+some+Obsidian+1.9.x+versions#What%20needs%20to%20change?)
  * **Obsidian 1.9.3** introduced a new option in the core **Format converter** plugin to update your notes automatically. 
    * See [How to fix unsupported properties](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tags%2C+aliases+and+cssclasses+in+some+Obsidian+1.9.x+versions#How%20to%20fix%20unsupported%20properties)
  * **Obsidian 1.9.4** behaves more robustly than the earlier 1.9.x versions, although it still has some issues. 
    * See [Things discovered whilst exploring this breaking change](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tags%2C+aliases+and+cssclasses+in+some+Obsidian+1.9.x+versions#Things%20discovered%20whilst%20exploring%20this%20breaking%20change)


Warning: Breaking changes in Obsidian 1.9.x
The [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) functionality in Obsidian 1.9.x is amazing.
However, it is important to note the following in the [Obsidian 1.9.0 (Insider) changelog](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2025-05-21-desktop-v1.9.0/):
Breaking changes
We have officially removed support for the properties `tag`, `alias`, `cssclass` in favor of `tags`, `aliases` and `cssclasses`. In addition, the values of these properties _must_ be a list. If the current value is a text property, it will no longer be recognized by Obsidian.
Consequences of this:
  * Searches that use **tags** in properties/frontmatter may no longer find expected, due to tags not being recognised, or being interpreted differently.
  * Notes with **aliases** may no longer be found, as their alias values may be ignored.
  * Notes with **cssclasses** may no longer be rendered as before, as their cssclass(s) values may be ignored.


All the following behaviours were observed and tested in Obsidian 1.9.4.
Properties | Obsidian 1.9.4 behaviour  
---|---  
**`tag`,`alias` , `cssclass`** | ❌ Ignored by Obsidian: no longer treated as `tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses`  
**`tags`that are not proper lists** | ✅ Obsidian highlights incorrectly-formatted `tags` in red.  
✅ Obsidian no longer deletes their values when making any changes to the file's properties.  
**`aliases`,`cssclasses` that are not proper lists** | ❌ Obsidian still does not warn about these.  
✅ Obsidian no longer deletes their values when making any changes to the file's properties.  
**`TAGS`,`ALIASES` , `CSSCLASSES`** | ✅ Still treated as `tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses`  
**Finding and fixing formatting problems** | ✅ New ["Properties" option in the Format Converter core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/format-converter#Properties) easily fixes wrongly-named and wrongly-formatted properties.  
**Restoring any lost data** | ❌ Because Obsidian 1.9.0, 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 may have already silently deleted mis-formatted list values, you may still notice missing data, and may wish to review a backup copy of your vault.  
All the following behaviours were observed and tested in Obsidian 1.9.2.
Properties | Obsidian 1.9.0, 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 behaviours  
---|---  
**`tag`,`alias` , `cssclass`** | ❌ Ignored by Obsidian: no longer treated as `tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses`  
**`tags`,`aliases` , `cssclasses` that are not proper lists** | ❌ Obsidian no longer warns about these.  
❌ Obsidian silently deletes their values when making any changes to the file's properties.  
**`TAGS`,`ALIASES` , `CSSCLASSES`** | ✅ Still treated as `tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses`  
**Finding problems** | ❌ Any problem values have to be **found** by the user, to prevent data loss  
**Fixed problems** | ❌ Any problem values have to be **fixed** by the user  
These examples, from the [Obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/format-converter#Properties), show the kind of edits needed:
  1. Property names may need updating.
  2. These are all list properties, so each value needs to be on a new line, preceded by a hyphen (`-`).


**Aliases:**
```
# Before

alias: My Note Title

# After

aliases:
  - My Note Title

```

**Tags:**
```
# Before

tag: project, important

# After

tags:
  - project
  - important

```

**CSS Classes:**
```
# Before

cssclass: custom-style

# After

cssclasses:
  - custom-style

```

The Obsidian team has now provided a mechanism to **update entire pre-Obsidian-1.9.0 vaults**.
Here is how to use it.
  1. Make a **backup of your vault**.
  2. Make sure you are using **Obsidian 1.9.3 or above**.
  3. Turn on the **[Format converter](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/format-converter)** core plugin.
![Turn on the 'Format converter' core plugin](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/core-plugin-format-converter.png) Turn on the 'Format converter' core plugin
  4. Run the **Open format converter** command.
  5. Turn on the **[Frontmatter migration](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/format-converter#Properties)** option.
  6. Click **Start conversion**.
![Select 'Frontmatter migration' option, and Start the conversion](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/40e62a316a834ff6f495ebf1d122cae6/images/core-plugin-format-converter-options.png) Select 'Frontmatter migration' option, and Start the conversion


Anecdotally, we have found that there is a higher-than-usual chance of getting an out-of-date Obsidian cache when a lot of files have changed.
This can result in problems like plugins not being able to find every task in the vault.
So for safety, after the format converter has completed, we would recommend that:
  1. You should [**regenerate the Obsidian metadata cache**](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tasks+in+callouts+with+some+Obsidian+1.6.x+versions#The+solution+Regenerate+the+Obsidian+metadata+cache).
  2. If your vault is synchronised with other devices, once each other device has finished syncing, you should repeat the cache regeneration step there too.


Some earlier notes that may still be of interest.
####  `tag`, `alias`, `cssclass` and properties 
If your vault uses the original names `tag`, `alias`, `cssclass` properties, it will benefit from using the Format converter.
Here is how to easily see if you have any old values needing to be updated.
  1. In the Obsidian **Search** box, paste in `["alias"]`.
  2. In the Obsidian **Search** box, paste in `["tag"]`.
  3. In the Obsidian **Search** box, paste in `["cssclass"]`.


####  `tags`, `aliases` and `cssclasses` with string values 
`tags`, `aliases` and `cssclasses` properties with string values will be wrongly interpreted by Obsidian 1.9.0 and above.
Here is one way to find them.
  1. Download the file **[Check Tags.base](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/tree/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/How%20To/Find%20properties%20not%20read%20by%20Obsidian%201.9.x)** - and open it in Obsidian 1.9.2 or newer.
  2. Download the file **[Check Aliases.base](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/tree/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/How%20To/Find%20properties%20not%20read%20by%20Obsidian%201.9.x)** - and open it in Obsidian 1.9.2 or newer.
  3. Download the file **[Check CssClasses.base](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/tree/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/How%20To/Find%20properties%20not%20read%20by%20Obsidian%201.9.x)** - and open it in Obsidian 1.9.2 or newer.


  * Check to see if the [Obsidian Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin has provided a way to find and fix problem properties.
  * A Discord user reported: 
> I thought I'd just raise awareness of this little python app written by someone in the Obsidian user community - it can bulk edit YAML properties - I used it myself to get all my YAML consistent to help with using Bases in my vault...it works really well! It has a dry run mode so you can test a change before committing it: <https://github.com/fussbanana/obsidian-frontmatter-tool>

Please follow the steps in this page **fully** when reporting a bug, to save your time and ours. Thank you.
Warning: Obsidian bug in versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.3 has caused some tasks not to be found
See [Missing tasks in callouts with some Obsidian 1.6.x versions](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Missing+tasks+in+callouts+with+some+Obsidian+1.6.x+versions) for how to make Obsidian 1.6.5 fix its metadata cache, in case it was broken by earlier 1.6.x versions.
Important
Don't waste your time crafting a careful bug report for something we already know about!
  *     * Read the [User Guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) for the problem feature.
    * We take care to record known limitations, often with a link to an existing issue that you can up-vote with a 👍.
  *     * Review the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22), to see if yours is listed.
    * If it is, up-vote it with a 👍.
  *     * Understand why the [order of items in a task matters](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Auto-Suggest#What+do+I+need+to+know+about+the+order+of+items+in+a+task%3F).
    * If a task is not found by a query, [check the task is formatted correctly](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Auto-Suggest#How+can+I+check+that+my+Task+is+formatted+correctly%3F).
    * Search for [tasks with invalid dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters).
  *     * Add the [explain](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Explaining+Queries) instruction to your query block.
    * Check how it interpreted the dates in your filters.
    * Make sure you have not confused `AND` and `OR`.
  *     * Run the Obsidian command `Open sandbox vault`.
    * Install and enable Tasks.
    * Confirm that you can reproduce the problem there.
    * Make a note of every individual step you needed to do, to reproduce the problem.


There is a [form to guide you through submitting a bug report](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/new/choose).
The rest of this section guides you through giving enough information for the bug to be investigated.
Warning: Issues created with GitHub's 'Reference in new issue' will be closed with no action
Occasionally we receive bug reports or feature requests that were created via GitHub's '[Reference in new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-comment)' facility.
Because they by-pass the Issue template mechanism, these do not have the information that we need to be able to act on requests.
We no longer have the time to go back and forth asking for the information manually that the templates request.
Please do not be offended when issues created via 'Reference in new issue' are just closed. It's nothing personal.
It's crucial that we receive a **text representation** of your files in order to be able to investigate issues.
Important
Trying to reproduce an issue based on a description or screenshot is time-intensive and error-prone, especially since there exists a plethora of themes and CSS-snippets which change how your tasks and checkboxes look.
To enable us to copy the raw text of your task, you need to put the task between two lines containing just `~~~`.
For example:
```
~~~
- [ ] My lovely task with 📅 2023-04-10 that Tasks search does not find
~~~

```

This will display as:
```
- [ ] My lovely task with 📅 2023-04-10 that Tasks search does not find

```

Again, to enable us to copy the raw text of your tasks query, you need to put the block between two lines containing just `~~~`.
For example:
```
~~~
```tasks
not done
due today
```
~~~

```

This will display as:
```
```tasks
not done
due today
```

```

Important
If we cannot reproduce the bug, we cannot fix it, and your bug-reporting efforts will have been wasted.
We do not have time to spend chasing up incomplete bug reports.
The bug report form has a section **'steps to reproduce'**.
Here, we need an **exact, complete, numbered** list of steps to perform, to reproduce the problem.
And these steps need to work in a vault that **has Tasks as the only enabled plugin**.
Info
See [Bug involving another plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Report+a+Bug#Bug%20involving%20another%20plugin) below for what to do if another plugin is involved.
This is the level of detail required for a developer to be able to reproduce a bug, taken from [issue #1300](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1300#issuecomment-1306829403):
Example steps to reproduce a particular bug
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Turn on "Use filename as scheduled date" in Tasks settings and restart Obsidian
  2. Create a file called `delete me - issue 1300 - 2022-11-02`.
     * **Note:** The file name matters, as it will be used in the query below
  3. Paste in to it the following content.
     * **Note:** You may need to hold down the shift key whilst pasting, to make sure the text is pasted in as raw text.
```
# delete me - issue 1300 - 2022-11-02

## Tasks

- [ ] Do stuff

## Tasks in This File

The group heading indicates whether or not the task has a scheduled date:

```tasks
not done
path includes delete me - issue 1300
group by scheduled
```

```

  4. View in **Reading Mode** :
     * Confirm that the group heading in the tasks code block is `2022-11-02 Wednesday`, matching the date in the file name (as opposed to `No scheduled date`, which would mean that the setting has not enabled)
  5. Click on the Pencil icon to the right of the task in the tasks code block
  6. Change the scheduled date to `2023-01-13`
  7. Click Apply
     * **Actual behaviour**
       * Nothing changes, as the new scheduled date is not saved.
     * **Expected behaviour:**
       * The original task line has `⏳ 2023-01-13`
       *          * The group heading changes to `⏳ 2023-01-13 Friday`
         * The task contains `⏳ 2023-01-13`
  8. Repeat the editing steps above in **Live Preview** mode
     * The same thing happens: the edited date is not applied to the task line


Warning
We do not generally work on problems of Tasks interacting with other plugins **unless the author of that plugin is willing to work jointly** on the problem.
Spending time getting familiar another plugin's settings, behaviour and code would take time away from improving Tasks.
Important
If you choose to still report a bug with another plugin, you **must give us a minimal zipped vault** , with:
  * just Tasks and the other plugin installed,
  * one or two notes that demonstrate the problem.


  1. Create a new Obsidian vault
  2.      * Update the Tasks settings if necessary
  3.      * Update the other plugin's settings if necessary
  4. Set up a new note with **the simplest possible content to demonstrate the problem**
  5. Confirm that you can reproduce the problem there.
  6. Make a note of every individual step you needed to do to reproduce the problem.


Once you have figured out the steps to reproduce the vault:
  1. Quit Obsidian
  2. Create a .zip file containing the minimal vault
  3. Create a [bug report](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/new/choose)
  4. Make sure you [Give steps to reproduce the bug](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Support+and+Help/Report+a+Bug#Give%20steps%20to%20reproduce%20the%20bug)
  5. Attach the zip file to the bug report, by dragging the file from your file browser into the bug report form
